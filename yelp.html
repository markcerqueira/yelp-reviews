            This was my first Yelp Elite event and it was a great one! Candice and Donna did an awesome job preparing some healthy snacks to munch on while we waited for our massage. Huge kudos to them!The event was pretty low-key as there were only a handful of Yelpers around. It was nice to be able to chat in a quiet place with a small group of people. Naturally, we talked at length about our favorite places of eat; our bookmark lists grew quite a bit!The massage itself was great. My masseuse, Daisy, really put on a good amount of pressure when I asked her to really dig in. The team at Elements Massage were all kind and friendly. The premises were clean and well-maintained. If you&#39;re in downtown San Mateo and looking for a massage before eating some delicious food, check out Elements!

            Sandwich Spot hits all the right spots so dang well! Everything about my first visit was beyond my expectations for an unassuming sandwich shop.They have FORTY signature sandwiches all at an extremely affordable price range (under 9 dollars)! Some are pretty standard like the #2 - Smokin&#39; Sequoia with turkey, bacon, cheddar, and avocado. Others are wild like #30 - Burn in Heaven which is a meatball sandwich with jalape√±os and Lava and Bomb sauce!The bread is freshly made. If you&#39;re asked if you mind waiting a few extra minutes for fresh-out-of-the-oven bread, the right answer is, &#34;Of course I don&#39;t mind waiting for delicious fresh bread! Do you take me for a mad person!?&#34;Pro tip! Bring a friend and get two sandwiches you&#39;re both into. Split the sandwiches and you&#39;ll get to sample two different bites of sandwich heaven. Don&#39;t forget: friends who eat delicious sandwiches together, stay together!During my first visit for lunch I had the Burn in Heaven and Hangover. Both we&#39;re absolutely on point! Not going to lie, I almost came back the same day for dinner. It was THAT good!

            Awash in a sea of Bay Area brunch spots, the nondescript Apple Fritter (formerly a Taco Bell) delivers a unique and hot-and-heavy (not to mention heavenly) dining experience! Come hungry, leave absolutely stuffed and satisfied!Their menu is loaded with delicious variety of cleverly named dishes to fill you right up. The Instagrammablewich is sure to get you some likes on a popular social photo sharing network! My go-to is the simple Ham, Egg and Cheese breakfast sandwich with a side of tater tots. It looks pretty unassuming but it packs a lot of flavor and more than satisfies my morning hunger. And you can&#39;t forget the donuts! They have a nice variety - anyone in the mood for a Maple Bacon Bar? I highly recommend trying the Apple Fritter. It is - not surprisingly - a large and delicious fritter packing a large apple-flavored punch.

            Pho Vi Hoa got a sterling recommendation from a friend so we rolled by one evening to check it out. The Vegetarian Spring Rolls we got as an appetizer to share were monstrous and tasty. I loved my pho with Eye Round Steak and Meatballs. The pho here comes with A LOT of meat and A LOT of noodles. All in all, I was really happy with my first visit! This place gets quite busy, but it&#39;s pretty large and does a good job of getting people in, fed, and out the door. Teaspoon is also right next door so don&#39;t forget to grab some delicious boba on your way out!

            A really great place to come for a date. It&#39;s got a cute, quaint, &#34;mood lighting&#34; ambiance. More importantly, the food is good too!A lot of reviewers talk about how the amazing Gnocchi in White Truffle Sauce. It&#39;s not overhyped! It is truly an amazing dish and definitely the most solid item on the menu. You can get an entree-worth of gnocchi but it is pretty heavy so we opted for the appetizer-sized version.Bread basket was on point. Yes - you can do a bread basket wrong! And Stella did it right. The bread was warm and the butter was not rock hard. It&#39;s easy to overlook these things so it&#39;s nice to see them get it right. Our entrees were good. The Rigatoni al Ragu di Maiale came with a very generous amount of smoked pork. The Scottadito di Agnello (lamb chops) were also good.We ended our meal with a Bread Pudding del Giorno. It was definitely a unique take on bread pudding. The pudding was covered in coconut flakes and served with a hot pineapple cream.All in all Stella provides a great ambiance, amazing gnocchi, good food, and - most importantly to a bread lover - warm bread and butter!

            A beyond-super friendly staff, a large selection of teas, and a nice assortment of tea-related accessories makes DAVIDs Tea an awesome one-stop shop for anyone looking to get into tea or try new tea flavors.Everything about this place screams cool. They have cool tea containers that lets you get your nose and fingers in the tea. Don&#39;t worry; they won&#39;t sell you the tea that everyone rubs their nose and fingers in! These containers also have a plethora of information about the tea. They make tea with fizzy water, which is cool too.If I had bought all the tea that interested me and smelled delicious, I would have walked out with a much lighter wallet and lots of tea, but I&#39;m taking it one at a time. See you soon, DAVIDs Tea!

            I wanted a single red rose. I called this place and asked if they sold them; got an enthusiastic &#34;everyday of the week&#34; response and told the florist would swing by later in the day. Dropped by an hour later and my single red rose was already prepared. $5 later I was out the door.In short - quick, easy, and the rose was wonderfully presented. Thanks, Dana!

            Rangoon Ruby is a classy establishment serving unique Burmese food.The menu is vast and the place runs smooth like butter. How smooth? We ordered a Mango Salad, Palata with Chicken, and Basil Beef. Each item came out as we were wrapping up the previously delivered item. The pacing was magical to say the least. Each item was pleasant to the palette offering unique twists on the Thai food I think it looks like. I particularly enjoyed the Palata. The entries are a little on the pricier side, but if you&#39;re looking for a classy meal don&#39;t hesitate to come here.

            Top notch sushi, but you don&#39;t have to take my word for it. A coworker of mine from Japan says this is his favorite sushi place in the the Bay Area. He says the soba is awesome. Call me crazy, but I trust Japanese people when it comes to Japanese food.That said, I enjoyed the food as well. The fish tasted really good and the rice was out of this world! It reminded me of the awesome rice I ate when I visited Japan. I had a roll with sweet seaweed and mackerel which was so damn good! I ate a bunch of my dining partner&#39;s chirashi and that was also so damn good! In short, this place is damn good! The place is somewhat small and very, very popular so don&#39;t come unless you have some time to wait to be seated and some time to wait for your food to come out. All that said, it&#39;s definitely worth it if you&#39;re craving some delicious sushi!

            On a Saturday morning in LA, my friends and I were craving a solid brunch. Fat Dog delivered 100% with friendly service and great food.We got some Biscuits and Jam to share and they were on point: flavorful, moist, and with a crunchy crust. We ended up getting another order because they were too good and we needed more. The Short Rib Hash was a pleasant twist on the traditional Eggs Benedict.And of course we got the Fat Dog. The Fat Dog is indeed a nice, thick, fat sausage worthy of your appetite and the sexual innuendo needed to satisfy the sexual frustration your party brings to the table after a Friday night out in the city.

            I bribed my coworkers - with the promise of donuts - to vote for my team in our company Halloween competition. We won. I needed to get donuts.Enter Chuck&#39;s Donuts. I came in late morning and there was still a very nice selection to choose from. For a great price, I got a variety of amazing donuts and munchkins (donut holes for those who grew up with Dunkin&#39; Donuts). Not surprisingly, the donuts were a hit with my coworkers!

            The only advice you really need to heed: Come hungry! Come hungry!! Come hungry!!!The best plan of attack is to have a light dinner the day before and come around 2 PM. Don&#39;t have breakfast. Don&#39;t have a snack. Around 2 PM, you&#39;ll miss the lunch rush and you&#39;ll still get the lunch price, which is almost half the dinner price. Don&#39;t expect to have an appetite by dinner either. I don&#39;t even think we were that hungry for lunch on the following day!We originally told ourselves we were going to walk around and look at everything they had to offer before digging in, but could not get past the first section which had an excellent selection of seafood items. They&#39;ve got everything here! To name a few that come to mind: seafood, barbecue, pizza, burgers, soup, tacos, cheese and meat, sushi, chinese dim sum, gelato, egg tarts.It&#39;s a buffet, but all the items were definitely above the typical mediocre buffet quality you expect at buffets.

The other things we ate like the Chinese Burger and Green Chives Pancake also hit the spot. Everything about Everyday Beijing is done right, which is even more amazing when you consider how large a menu they have. Service is also friendly to boot!Take a walk down B Street to Everyday Beijing and I can promise you won&#39;t regret it.

            Vesta has astounding appetizers and amazing pizza! My team rushes here for team lunches and we always saunter away very full and very happy. Definitely get the Mushroom Toast! It&#39;s so, so, so good! All the different types of pizza we&#39;ve tried are good, but everyone has their favorite. My favorite is the Mushroom because it has mushrooms and strong, bold flavors courtesy of the truffle oil and goat cheese.To be honest, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever regretted a bite of anything Vesta has dished out. And many times those bites have brought me to the verge of pizza heaven.

            I&#39;ve walked past this FIVE-STAR establishment so many times. When I finally tried it, tears of joy streamed down my face.Definitely get the Bruschetta. Actually, that&#39;s probably all you need to get. You get to pick four different types per order, which is great because it gives you a ton of flexibility. You can go just with savory selections, or sweet, or a mix of both. My dining team enjoyed all the selections we sampled, but favorites included Mango, Tomato and Avocado and the Smoked Salmon, Cream Cheese, and Capers.

            Amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing, amazing pizza! My waistline hates it, but I come here almost once a week! My go-to is a plain Cheese Slice and a Seniore&#39;s Slice. Both are AMAZING. The Chicken Pesto Slice is also great. The crust is thick and soft and they don&#39;t skimp on the amount of cheese and toppings they put on these magnificent creations. Extra cheese on the slice: prices are also very reasonable! Thank you, Seniore&#39;s for bringing pizza happiness into my life so often!

            I got the Katana-Ya Ramen with Rich Miso broth and it was great. Among many other things, the ramen comes with fried chicken karaage, dumplings and pork. The variety was certainly enjoyable and bumped up my feelings about the place. The ramen cost $13, but it&#39;s a super large bowl. I finished everything except the noodles. :)My fresh-off-the-boat Japanese friend (born and raised in Japan, only very recently came to the USA) said he really liked it. But knowing Japanese people it was probably just okay by his high Japanese-ramen-standards and he was just being super nice.Also, unlike most other places in San Francisco, it&#39;s open late. Last call is at 1:15 AM so don&#39;t show up right before closing time (2 AM) and except to eat some ramen!

            The food is great. I think this place is related to the Champagne Restaurant in Millbrae - that I really like - because their menu seems identical. Super solid dim sum across the board. The Fried Pumpkin is great, the Shanghai Soup Dumplings are great, and the Steamed BBQ Pork Buns are great. Everything was spot on.Except the service. I was somewhat tempted to dock a star for the several service faux pas the waiters put my party through, but ultimately, I judge a restaurant&#39;s worth by the food that goes in my mouth.In short - good dim sum, but don&#39;t be surprised if service isn&#39;t stellar... or good... or decent... or mediocre.

            It&#39;s always a good day when Indian Bento is serving lunch at my company. The food is ¬†spot on. The Chicken Tikka Masala is flavorful without the heavy cream laden heaviness you get elsewhere. My friend is a big fan of Saag Paneer and really enjoys their Saag Paneer.My only complaint is about the naan, which is more like pita bread than naan.

            I once saw a couple walk into Naru Bento, eye the humble menu containing 5 entrees, scoff at the &#34;limited&#34; selection, and then walk out. That day, I saw a couple of fools.Naru Bento is awesome. Seriously. The menu isn&#39;t huge, but it doesn&#39;t have to be. You&#39;ll likely get addicted to one item and then only want to eat that. Pork Katsu is my vice. My dining partner really likes their Minced Pork over Rice. Sometimes we share an order of Popcorn Chicken. It&#39;s great!I visit at least once a week. I always tell myself I&#39;m going to try something new, but I always get the Pork Katsu. And I never regret it.My only complaint is the seasoning is off sometimes: it will be too powdery sometimes and other times the fried crust doesn&#39;t even stick to the meat. Also, their compostable eating utensils are super environmentally friendly, but they make eating difficult sometimes. BYOS - Bring Your Own Silverware!!!

            YES! So it seems the way to a 5-star review from me is either amazing bubble tea or great deep-fried sushi. Sushi 85 delivers on the latter in so many amazing ways.They have a wide selection of regular, baked, and deep-fried rolls; some are okay, some are wonderful, and some take me to paradise!Here is my roll-by-roll breakdown:* Crazy Roll - Deep fried California roll - 4/5 - Simple, but great* Texas Roll - Salmon, avocado, cream cheese (deep fried) - 5/5 - PARADISE!* Bat Man - Unagi, cream cheese, crab, chef&#39;s sauce (deep fried) - 5/5 - SO CREAMY!* Cowboy Roll - Salmon, cream cheese, salmon and avocado on top - 4/5 - Good, but not amazing* Popcorn Shrimp Roll - Ebi, cucumber, popcorn shrimp on top - 2/5 - Popcorn shrimp is good, but the roll under is disappointingMore updates to come as I explore more of the menu!

            I visit this post office a lot. The employees at the front desk are all really friendly and I&#39;ve only had positive experiences interacting with them. Sometimes there can be a wait because a lot of people don&#39;t come with their packages 100% prepared. The manager could be a little more diplomatic though. Once, a USPS mail carrier picked up a package FedEx dropped off at my door. Later, I got an angry call from the manager who was blaming me for the situation. I tried to explain how unreasonable it was that I was being blamed for their mistake, but the manager didn&#39;t seem to even care about what I had to say. Oh wells...

            An English-style pub with a surprising lack of Scottish brews. My friend (who went to school in Edinburgh) and I shared some standard bar-comfort-food: Potato Skins and Chicken Tenders.

            A quirky little hole-in-the-wall sushi place that serves sushi prepared with brown rice. As with all quirky sushi places, sushi snobs should stay very far away!The brown rice is a pleasant twist; it tastes good and it doesn&#39;t feel like I&#39;m sacrificing taste for a &#34;healthier&#34; rice. I usually order Inari and some rolls. The Una-Avo (eel and avocado) is my favorite roll. They get all the basics right: the fish is fresh and the rolls have a good blend of flavors and textures. The place is run by a chef and his twin sons. They look identical, but I think one is more boisterous than the other! The one down-side here is that with one chef, food can come out slow at times. Stay strong as your patience will be rewarded with interesting sushi.

            They should consider changing the name of this place to Menlo Korean BBQ - A Korean Twist on American Classics.Case in point: the Bulgogi Burger with Garlic Fries. The worst thing about a hamburger is when the meat is overcooked and dry. Fortunately, bulgogi - even when cooked thoroughly - is still juicy and tender. Problem solved! The burger was great: juicy and filled with flavor. The Garlic Fries also being amazing was frosting on the cake!

            If you&#39;re craving beer, wine, and comfort food, look no further than Fat Angel. It will more than deliver on your expectations. My dining partner and I shared some Maple Bacon Butter. It was great; I definitely want to come back to try other flavors like Garlic Chili and Honey. We also got Sliders, a Basil Pesto Flatbread, and a Spicy Mac n&#39; Cheese. This sounds completely unexciting, but everything we tried was really superb. Thanks for the great meal, Fat Angel!

            Beware! Entering this restaurant is a hazard if you&#39;re already on Route 1. Basically, you need to merge into a lane where cars are entering and accelerating to get onto Route 1. If it was any other state where drivers aren&#39;t complete and total jerk-offs, this wouldn&#39;t be a problem, but what can I say? New Jersey drivers are cream of the crop when it comes to being &#34;courteous.&#34; Check Aja&#39;s website for &#34;safer&#34; entrance directions.AJA pretty much hits a bunch of the Asian food groups: Japanese, Thai, Chinese. They also have a well-stocked bar and the decor is very, very appealing to the eyes. The food itself is okay. My dining party mostly focused on the Japanese menu; we had Gyoza, Shumai, a Sushi and Sashimi platter, and some rolls. Everything was okay. The one really sour point was the bone my dining partner found in his sashimi, which is inexcusable in any sushi place.

            Right next door to Sharetea -- my favorite bubble tea place ever. I was happy I wasn&#39;t griefed to death for bringing in an outside drink, but perhaps I was just very discreet. I know it&#39;s not exactly courteous, but in MY AMERIKA I should be able to have my favorite bubble tea and eat some desserts at the same time. We tried the Jumbo Thai Crepe and the Na Ya Toast with Chili Paste and Shredded Pork. The pork and turkey sausage in the crepe was a bit weird, but then again it is a pork and turkey sausage. The menu is extensive. As long as they don&#39;t mind me enjoying some outside bubble tea, I&#39;ll happily come back to try more of their stuff!

            Rolls were good, but the appetizers were disappointing.The Fried Calamari tasted stale. The Gyoza had a &#34;fresh out of the microwave&#34; texture. The Crab Croquettes were a bit dry.Rolls fared a lot better in our book. We all enjoyed the seared filet mignon on the Early Bird and the spicy kick the Extinguisher packed. I love cream cheese so I tried their Philadelphia Roll, which deviates a bit from the standard formula and adds avocado. I&#39;m a fan of this modification!

            My friend and I went with the $48 BBQ Charcoal Set for 2. Pretty pricey, but a ton of food came out. You get the standards: a bowl of rice, rice tea, and Korean Banchan. You get a hefty amount of Rib Eye and Chicken. And you even got some Soft Tofu Stew. As always, there is a helpful Korean lady to help you cook your meat. We were definitely not prepared for the amount of food, but thoroughly devoured and enjoyed everything that came our way. It&#39;s pricey and it probably will be even more expensive during my next visit. Prices are probably going up as often as rent is in San Francisco. Every price label seems to have been changed 4-5 times given the stack of small white labels displaying the price. Pro tip - if you really enjoy any of the Banchan dishes, don&#39;t hesitate to ask for some more.

            Whitehorse Tavern is an all-around solid dining establishment. The service is friendly and professional, the rustic decor is beautiful without being too overbearing or obnoxious, and -- mostly importantly -- the food is delicious. My party shared some Fried Calamari and Jalape√±o Polenta. The polenta was a hit. I had a Light Horse Tavern (LHT) Burger and it was top-notch. I&#39;m always impressed when a restaurant heeds my request to cook my burger medium-rare. Yes, there is a small chance it might cause some gastrointestinal discomfort later on, but I&#39;m willing to take the risk, especially when great flavor is on the line.

            The butcher of choice for my family for over 20 years. Even when we moved out of Newark, we still make the trek down when the meat freezer starts running low. Yes -- we have a freezer just for meat. They also have really good presunto. If you&#39;re a fan of cured meats (or just meat in general), I&#39;d highly recommend you check this place out to satisfy your carnal desires.

            Okay, but not great. Let&#39;s take the Chicken Tikka Masala -- my benchmark of Indian buffet quality. The sauce is thick, creamy, and flavorful at Clay Oven. But the chicken itself is disappointingly dry and chewy.I probably won&#39;t come back; there doesn&#39;t appear to any great Indian options in San Mateo, but there are plenty in the Bay Area. I&#39;ll go to those instead.

            Red Pepper provides a ridiculously inexpensive ($12) and wonderful lunch buffet.The Chicken Tikka Masala is so freaking creamy. Seriously -- I felt like I was eating pieces of chicken-flavored butter given how each piece just decadently melted in my mouth. Aside from the chicken, they had a bunch of my favorite dishes including Malai Kofta and Paneer Makhani.

            Perfection is sometimes muddled with subjective opinions, but Levain&#39;s cookies are perfect, and that&#39;s AN ABSOLUTE FACT.I don&#39;t like chocolate, which eliminates most of the cookie menu for me, but all I need is an Oatmeal Raisin Cookie and I&#39;M IN HEAVEN. They are so large, so wonderfully delicious, so juicy, and quite frankly, so absolutely perfect. If I could marry a Levain&#39;s cookie, I would do it in a heartbeat!SERIOUSLY. PERFECT.

            My visit to Luke&#39;s Lobster was spurred by the highest recommendation from a friend. Luke&#39;s did a great job of living up to my expectations.My friend and I had the Noah&#39;s Ark which let us try the lobster, crab, and shrimp rolls (and a bag of chips and a drink). There wasn&#39;t a biblical flood during our visit, but Noah&#39;s Ark guided us to some wonderful promised land of SANDWICH NIRVANA. We both agree they were all delicious, but the lobster definitely won us over the most.The sandwiches are a bit small. Even after eating the rolls, we were both still pretty hungry. That said, I know seafood is expensive so this isn&#39;t completely unreasonable. Also, looking on the positive side, Luke&#39;s leaves plenty of room for some delicious cookies from Levain Bakery which is only a quick walk away!From the name to Noah&#39;s Ark, there are a lot of biblical references being thrown around and I think that&#39;s for a good reason. Luke&#39;s Lobster is truly a gift from a higher place!

            My cousin had her wedding ceremony here. The grounds are beautiful. The reception was in the barn. Don&#39;t worry -- it&#39;s a very nicely furnished barn with stellar air conditioning.The hors d&#39;oeuvre were served on the ground floor. Then we moved up a floor (right under the roof) for more food and dancing. It was a hot, steamy night in New Jersey, but great air conditioning and excellent circulation kept the climate of the entire evening extremely pleasant. Best part of the whole thing to a tech nerd? Terrible cell phone reception, but a WiFi network with more than tolerable speeds. Huzzah! So proud of my cousin for excellent discretion when it comes to wedding venues!

            Absurdly long line for weekend dim sum, but this restaurant spans multiple floors, so the wait wasn&#39;t that bad. The food was good; they got enough things right that I gave it a thumbs up at the end of the meal. In short, I&#39;d come back here for dim sum again.Worth nothing:* They don&#39;t have Shanghai Soup Dumplings (xiaolongbao). Sadness!* They have a cart that is a mobile dumpling cart. You pick the dumplings you want and the lady cooks (more like reheats them) and serves them to you. Some dumplings from this magical cart were lukewarm though, which kind of ruins the whole point of the cart in my opinion.

            MomFUKU YEAH! This place is awesome.I had the Milk Cereal Soft Serve with Crunch. The flavor of the soft serve was just perfect; it tasted just like milk after you finish all of your cereal. The added crunch toppings (corn flakes) enhanced this nostalgia trip back to my cereal-filled childhood.My only complaint was the consistency of the soft serve was a bit off. It tasted (and looked) icy at times. That said, I&#39;ll definitely visit again when I&#39;m in the city.

            Run by the same team behind Ramen Dojo (up a block), but a tad bit bigger and with its own parking lot. The ramen is great; I had the Garlic Miso Lobster Pork Ramen. It&#39;s packed with flavor and the ingredients jive well. Get the Soft-Boiled Egg; it&#39;s a must!The lobster ramen gave the meat a fishy flavor, which sounds weird, but honestly it was pretty good! The Gyoza, Chicken Karaage, and Fried Oysters were also good. Not sure if Parlor is better than Dojo. I&#39;ll have to visit the two some more to properly assess these two siblings. Poor me!

            The beer selection is good.A plate of Deviled Eggs costs about ten dollars and gets you NINE amazing deviled eggs. SO FREAKING GOOD! It definitely lived up to the all the hype you see on here.The Cheeseburger on sliced sourdough was okay. Definitely overcooked, but it wasn&#39;t bad. The Sweet Potato Fries were good; they are cut a little big and not crispy at all. My only complaints are the pitchers are pretty small (but the price is not), and they are super slow taking orders and super slow getting food out. All in all, definitely my go-to bar in the area!

            AWW HELL YISS!!!!Finally, a competitor that can go toe-to-toe with my favorite deep-fried sushi joint -- Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose -- has emerged: Furagu Sushi. Two visits in and I&#39;m in love. Their fried rolls are amazing. The Lion King is great, the Dynamite Roll is amazing, and the Las Vegas Roll satisfies my deep-fried cream cheese cravings. The hand rolls and appetizers we&#39;ve tried so far (gyoza, chicken karaage, fresh oysters) have also been spot on. My dining partner wasn&#39;t a fan of their sashimi, but I don&#39;t come here for sashimi; I come here for DEEP-FRIED AMAZING STUFF!Run, don&#39;t walk to Furagu Sushi and prepare yourself for a blissful experience!

            If you cross the San Mateo Bridge and just keeping going once you reach the other side, you&#39;ll eventually end up in downtown Hayward and there you will find Siam Palace, a quaint Thai restaurant that does a good job across the board. My dining party enjoyed Thai Roti (Thai equivalent of Indian naan), Chicken Satay, Tom Kha Soup, Beef Curry, and a Pumpkin Curry. The Fried Banana with Ice Cream topped off an excellent meal. My only complaint is about their soup pots and the spoons they come with. The spoon is a tad bit too big so getting the soup from pot to bowl is an exercise in frustration. That said, once you start eating, it&#39;s all good!

            6000+ reviews and a 4.5 star rating more than confirms that Ike&#39;s Place is serving up some amazing sandwiches. The only downside to this place is picking a single sandwich from the many, many sandwiches they offer. My friend and I split a Super Mario (meatball with mozzarella sticks) and a Hot Momma Huda (chicken with buffalo sauce). Both were amazing. Great bread and great ingredients resulting in great sandwich synergy. The Huda is named after Ike&#39;s mom. To raise such a maestro of sandwich-making, she must be one amazing lady!Now to live in the dilemma that is trying a new sandwich or continuing to eat the sandwiches I love. Life is truly difficult sometimes...

            Enjoyed a nice Saturday brunch here. My friend was into her Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict and I found the Breakfast Burrito -- with chunks of chorizo and topped with a creamy sauce -- delicious. We split a Blueberry Pancake and regretted only getting one! We&#39;ll definitely be back to try some of their other stuff.

            Nothing amazing here, but if you&#39;re craving a cheese steak and some fries (or other fried goodies), this place will get the job done. The staff is friendly, but ultimately mediocre ingredients beget &#34;just okay&#34; cheesesteaks.

            Fancy-ish burgers for a fancy-ish price. The fries are great, especially if you get them with truffle oil or make them manly (cheddar and bacon). They have specials that change every few weeks which always sound very interesting, so you may be pleasantly surprised during a future visit.I really wish they would have the cheesy tater tots more often. So far, they&#39;re only 1 for 4 of my visits. That&#39;s not enough tater tots, Umami!!!

            Yep, it&#39;s a dive bar. And yes, the food is freaking AMAZING.They seemingly have it all on their menu and they do it all so freaking well. The Mac and Cheese is ridiculously amazing. Want a Pulled Pork in a Waffle Cone? Yes, it exists and it is wonderful. You want oysters? They got it. You want a hamburger or a pulled pork sandwich? They got it. You want Fish and Chips? You&#39;ll get one massive piece of fish with fries. My only complaint is they only have two people working the bar and taking orders so sometimes it&#39;s a bit slow to get your order in. That said, patience will be rewarded with an amazing culinary experience!

            The Pesto Margarita crepe was pretty good. For $10, I was expecting more than 2 small crepes. But then again, I am in the SOMA neighborhood of San Francisco, so everything is magically more expensive. The chicken inside the crepe was surprisingly juicy. That said, this was more of a snack, and not a meal. If you want to pay $10 for a snack, come on by!Also, shouldn&#39;t a place called The Creamery really have ICE CREAM!?

            Aside from one very, very important thing, this place is absolutely fantastic. Everything we had really, really knocked our socks off!We finally found a place that serves large, juicy chunks of Chicken Karaage. The Fried Pork Dumplings are just pan-fried pork shumai, but still great nonetheless. The Cream Crab Croquette are so decadent and delicious. The ramen was flavorful, had plenty of meat, and was very quickly taken care of. The only very important thing holding this place back from perfection? The noodles in the ramen are really not up to the par. And noodles are a pretty important part of ramen. They were super thin, and really unimpressive. I didn&#39;t even bother finishing them! If excellent noodles are a must-have, this place may not be up your alley.

            My company is right across the street and we come to Tres every so often for some boozing. The place is large and has a massive tequila selection, so if you can hang with large amounts of tequila, this is the place to be.The food is pretty good too. I had a Hamburguesa con Queso Oaxaca the other day. Two burger patties with a bunch of string oaxaca cheese in between. The burger was juicy and had a little kick thanks to the jalape√±os.

            $6 for ONE Taco (Nick&#39;s Way) seems a bit excessive, but the taco&#39;s tortilla is barely able to contain everything inside.

            Yay! Another good dim sum place in the Bay Area, and another point for Millbrae having the nicest selection of Chinese restaurants in the area.The Steamed BBQ Pork Buns had some wonderfully soft bread and were filled with a good amount of juicy pork. The Shanghai Soup Dumplings were also on point. The Shrimp and Pork Shumai were absolutely massive.We also tried the Baked Seafood over Fried Rice with Portuguese Sauce. As a Portuguese person, I give this dish my stamp of delicious approval!

            Cucina Urbana delivers an amazing Italian dining experience from start to finish. I&#39;d highly recommend what my party had to eat because everything was superb. We had the Pepperoni and Fennel Sausage Pizza (pizza isn&#39;t authentically Italian but it was still great), the Lasagna al Forno (piping hot and delicious), and the Roasted Strawberry Fregolata (wonderful blend of custard and gelato).

            DELISH! The flight of appetizers my group ordered to share were all thoroughly enjoyed. Then the ramen came out. My (extremely inebriated but cultured) friend proclaimed the ramen here is the best he&#39;s had outside of Japan. Not sure I can commit to such high praise, but the ramen was in fact pretty damn good. The one thing that was kind of disappointing was how little there was in the bowl of ramen because it was mostly JUST noodles. For $9.25 I don&#39;t expect to get a ton of meat and veggies, but I do expect at least more than ONE PIECE of pork chasu.

            Shorehouse Kitchen has a lot of things going for it: it&#39;s right near the beach, the outdoor seating area is wonderful, the staff is super friendly, and the food is good... BUT not amazing. The Buttermilk Pancakes and Buttermilk Biscuits tasted a bit bland. The Classic Eggs Benedict was good, but again, didn&#39;t blow me away. Case in point -- when I asked my friend about our experience, he said he thought the servers were all very attractive, and he didn&#39;t even mention the food.

            It&#39;s not my favorite comfort sushi place (Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose), but it&#39;s close in both quality and distance from home. Their fried rolls are pretty awesome.

            WOW WOW WOW! These are some amazing donuts! My favorites are the Maple Cake Donut and the Buttermilk Maple Donut. They have a microwave near the register that you should use to up the deliciousness of your donuts if you&#39;re eating them there. Some friends and I attempted the donut challenge. You basically have 3 minutes to each one of their LARGE donuts. It&#39;s hard; only 2 out of the 5 of us succeeded, which is above the average 10% pass rate. If you want to take the challenge be sure to call in the day before to reserve a big donut because they sell out fast! I failed the challenge, but still enjoyed the rest of the large donut, AND a Buttermilk Maple Donut afterwards!

            A fancy establishment that doesn&#39;t make me feel like a peon. The service is really friendly and down-to-Earth. The food is also amazing. The Ricotta Gnocchi was delicious; the gnocchi was so soft. My main entr√©e, the Scottish Salmon &#34;En Croute,&#34; was also amazing. The salmon was so tender. It melted in my mouth like butter. My old roommate has been wanting to bring me to Peacock Inn for the longest time. After a meal here, I can definitely understand why. It was a great time.

            As You Like It offers a nice selection of hard serve ice cream, and soft serve ice cream flavors beyond the traditional vanilla and chocolate flavors. Drop by and give them a shot -- you won&#39;t regret it.

            I prefer Bent Spoon, but if you&#39;re looking for different flavors or for soft serve, go to Halo Pub, as they offer the most variety of flavors in town. It&#39;s not my favorite, but it&#39;s still pretty awesome.

            Gabriel&#39;s serves lunch and dinner, but I&#39;ve only been there to get their ice cream. Because their ice cream offerings are totally LEGIT. Soft serve? Yes. Plenty of hard serve ice cream flavors? Yep. Waffle cones? Sure. Chocolate-covered waffle cones? They&#39;ve got it. Sprinkles? Hell yes. When it comes to options, Gabriel&#39;s just CAN&#39;T be beat.One day, I&#39;ll come in and give their lunch or dinner menu a shot. But that means there will be less room for ice cream, which I&#39;m not sure is EVER an option.

            &#34;OMG OMG OMG&#34; was my reaction when I first looked at Usagi&#39;s menu because it&#39;s covered in tons of amazing things. I had the Usagi Burg with Fried Shrimp and Crab Cream Croquette. WOW! It was very good. All the sides were happily devoured. My friend had the Pork Kurobata Curry and it was SO GOOD too. Every time I come to Usagi, I know it&#39;s going to be an amazing time because they do Japanese comfort food so dang well. And they are not one-trick-ponies as their menu packs a wide variety of dishes that they prepare oh-so-well!

            My favorite Indian restaurant in Princeton. The chef used to work at Mehek, but then decided to open his own restaurant. The chef is an artist who dishes out amazing food. When I attended college, my friends and I visited the old restaurant he used to work at (Mehek) every week, and we NEVER got tired of the food. The lunch buffet is a ridiculously amazingly deal. My favorite dishes here include the creamy and decadent Chicken Makhani, the Vegetable Korma, and Malai Kofta. Some days were amazing and I got all three in the buffet line-up, but even when none made it on the list, I wouldn&#39;t even get mad because it&#39;s all so good.

            As is the norm with most sushi buffets, you&#39;ll be getting a lot of rice, and very little fish with your sushi. It&#39;s great if you just want to stuff your face with sushi and don&#39;t care much about quality. And guess what? Sometimes I just want to stuff my face with mediocre sushi. But actually, my favorite thing about Minado isn&#39;t the sushi, but the Green Tea and Vanilla Soft Serve. MORE PLEASE!

            Sounds like a Portuguese bakery, looks like a Portuguese bakery, and pumps out pastries like a Portuguese bakery, but this place does something MORE than the usual Portuguese bakery: Pasteis de Nata (Custard Cups) infused with chocolate!Chocolate lovers (unfortunately, that does not include me) -- rejoice! You can bite into a tasty custard cup that has a layer of chocolate on the bottom. Even my friend who&#39;s not a huge fan of custard cups admitted she was quite taken by this confectionary twist. I&#39;m not a fan of chocolate so I can only judge them on their regular Custard Cups: to be honest, I still prefer Teixeira&#39;s, but if you want to change it up, this is the place to try.

            Bent Spoon offers amazing ice cream, cookies, and cupcakes. You just can&#39;t go wrong here. Case in point -- while visiting Princeton for 3 days, I somehow ended up visiting Bent Spoon 6 times. It&#39;s that DAYUM good. My favorite thing is the Croissant Ice Cream Sandwich -- both innovative and wonderfully tasty.

            Fruity Yogurt does some things really well. They have a nice selection of frozen yogurt, including some frozen greek yogurt and even soft serve. On the other hand, the mochi toppings my friend got were very stale and the Black Milk Tea I got had an unexpected cinnamon flavor to it. In short, get the froyo, but skip the toppings and bubble tea.

            Popped in today to get some gluten-free pizza. The guy at the front isn&#39;t the most enthusiastic person you&#39;ll meet, but he took our order and got it going quickly enough.The pizza itself was good. It was hot, and all the ingredients jived well together. The only problem was that the crust was burnt here and there. I can imagine they don&#39;t use the gluten-free crusts often, so again, I don&#39;t hold this against them too much, but will dock a star for it!

            Cups offers a very, very, VERY nice selection of flavors. They had all my favorites -- NY Cheesecake, Dulce de Leche, Strawberry, Peanut Butter, Vanilla -- and then some! Some of the machines produced yogurt that was a little too runny though. That said, all the flavors still tasted great, not watered down as I feared.

Some of the dishes also aren&#39;t authentically Portuguese, but I can&#39;t knock them because chicken drizzled in creamy sauce always make me happy.In short, Taste of Portugal is okay. For Portuguese food, I still prefer Portugalia on Ferry Street.

            Yes, it&#39;s a chain restaurant, but I thoroughly enjoyed my visit to Carrabba&#39;s. Everything was good and -- occasionally -- GREATNESS was achieved.The basket filled with soft, hot bread with a side of olive oil for dipping was great. I had a half of my mom&#39;s Chicken Parmesan (one serving has two HUGE pieces of chicken), and it was also great. I ALSO had a bite of the Rigatoni Martino - mm mm creamy and delicious. They even have a gluten-free menu so my sister could eat without too much worry. But it was the Apple Crostata desert that really sealed the deal. Man, was it freaking amazing! I&#39;m tempted to come visit again (alright, probably more than once) JUST to have this desert again.

            Palomino delivers an excellent experience across the board. It&#39;s located on the Embarcadero with a nice view of the Bay Bridge. The all-day Happy Hour lets you order tapas all-day, so you can order a lot of different things without feeling disgustingly full.My coworker and I split a bunch of things -- and enjoyed everything! The Portabella Mushroom Soup was awesome: flavorful and thick with an interesting sweet red garnish. The Salsiccia Fresca Pizza had a super thin, super crunchy crust. The Sicilian Meatballs seemed a bit gooey, but I think it&#39;s because they inject them with cheesy goodness (ALWAYS a good thing in my book).We definitely enjoyed our visit. The food was great, the ambiance was great, and service was great. Thanks, Palomino!

            BB Tea Station is a pretty solid choice for bubble tea in San Francisco. This place reminds me a lot of Tpumps. The boba is really soft and chewy. The tea is good: not too sweet, but not super bitter either. But unlike Tpumps, I got a good amount of boba! Huzzah!

            I came here with a bunch of my Asian friends after one mentioned this was his hang-out joint. This place did not disappoint. The food was stellar, the food came out quickly, the staff was friendly, and we even got complimentary dessert. I don&#39;t know the names of all the dishes we got, but everything was boss. The guy who frequents this place likes their Congee. Turns out I like it too.Like other Hong Kong-style cafes, this place has a huge menu, so if you come back, you can always try something new.Also, the chairs are purple, and there are shiny tiles on the wall. The design of this place is like a disco hall crossed with a baby girl&#39;s bedroom. Can&#39;t knock it because even though the interior makes my eyes hurt, it&#39;s a clean space, and -- most importantly -- they dish out awesome food.

            Decent hot dogs. I enjoyed a Heart Attack - hopefully the only time you&#39;ll hear me say that. It came with chili, extra meat, cheddar cheese, jalape√±os, and some other cholesterol-laden stuff. Everything was okay - nothing terrible, yet nothing mind-blowing. If I&#39;m craving a hot dog, I&#39;ll drop by again, but this place wasn&#39;t good enough to inspire cravings on its own.

            I&#39;m not really surprised anymore when I find an awesome Chinese restaurant in Millbrae; this town is PACKED with delicious Chinese food.Everything we ordered was great. I really liked the Barbecue Pork... And secretly wish I had some soft Chinese-style bread to stuff the pork into. The Fried Porkchop was also wonderful - better than a lot of pork katsu I&#39;ve had at Japanese restaurants. The Braised Beef Brisket was also awesome, especially the broth that doubled as yummy soup. The menu is huge, and I&#39;m an elated first-time customer, so I&#39;ll definitely be back!

            Mayflower in one sentence: AWESOME DIM SUM!A bunch of us dropped by at 10 AM (opening). The place was deserted, but the carts were coming out of the kitchen. Everything we tried was good. The Steamed and Baked BBQ Pork Buns (my personal measuring tool of dim sum quality) were both awesome. The Shumai was also on point - containing a massive amount of yummy pork. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s because we came in super early and the place wasn&#39;t that busy, but everyone was really nice to us. One of the servers was so impressed one of us (who wasn&#39;t Asian) wanted Chicken Feet. She dropped off the Chicken Feet and then came back with some napkins for him because she knew he&#39;d be needing them. Looking back, I was kind of disappointing to realize that we got no Shanghai Soup Dumplings. I suppose it&#39;s something to look forward to next time!

            You can take the Quickly out of the name, but you can&#39;t take the Quickly out of the food quality. It seems this used to formerly be a Quickly. I only tried the Bubble Tea, which was average - exactly what I&#39;d expect out of Quickly. FYI - if this place is really, really like Quickly, then the Asian-style fried snacks are probably great.

            Wow! Toto&#39;s is doing some great things. A few months back I popped in and got a Meatball Sandwich that I really enjoyed. I held off on writing a review because who writes a review of a pizzeria without trying the pizza? The time finally arrived, and our meal was great. The Meatball Sliders were good, except the meat was a little dry. Fortunately, we got a bowl of marinara sauce to complement our Cheesy Garlic Bread, which helped moisten up the dry meat. The pizza was great. We got a regular crust plain pizza and a thick crust Pizza a la Toto&#39;s No. 5.The one major downside is this place seems a bit lacking in the dining-in experience. There is no table service, so you go up to the register to order. They do bring out your food to you, but don&#39;t expect to get refills on your drinks, even when there are plenty of employees loitering behind the counter. That said, there&#39;s no table service, so the expectation for service was pretty low.

            While waiting to get seated at Cha Cha Sushi, my friends and I popped in for a slice of pizza. We got a personal pizza - small enough to not fill us up, but big enough for us to each get a slice of pizza. It was piping hot and pretty good!I feel kind of bad for this place because it&#39;s right next door to the Cha Cha powerhouse. The &#34;angry&#34; signs outside saying people waiting for Cha Cha shouldn&#39;t stand in front of Bona Pizza are understandable, but it really seems like Bona Pizza missed a really great opportunity for fostering some interest. Serve pizza by the slice! Give out pizza samples to people waiting in front of your restaurant! Cha Cha doesn&#39;t do delivery, so give people a taste of what you have to offer, and maybe you&#39;ll be putting your delicious pizza in more people&#39;s mouths.

            Okay food at an okay price. I had the Romania Panini. It was good, but fell short of great. The pastrami was a little too chewy so one bite would take with it far too much pastrami. But honestly, the sandwich could&#39;ve used a little more pastrami in general. My friend had some Vegetarian Chili which was good, and the Salmon Risotto was so creamy. ¬†In short, decent, but could be better with just a few improvements here and there.

            Irving Street is packed with Asian dessert places, but ETC Dessert Cafe is leagues above its neighbors. Not only does it have an awesomely weird name, it is open later than the competition, the service is very friendly, and the drinks and food are great. I enjoyed my smoothie and the Toast with Strawberry and Vanilla Ice Cream. Next time I&#39;m craving some late-night dessert, I&#39;m just going to skip the rest and head to the best: ETC Dessert Cafe.

            My fixation with dumplings can NEVER be satisfied. I love all kinds of dumplings, so I decided to pop in and see if they had any Korean-style dumplings. This place DELIVERED with tons of dumplings, including Korean-style kimchi dumplings.The one downside: Compared to the 99 Ranch or Marina, the prices here are STEEP. I can get three bags of Chinese dumplings for less than the price of two here. That said, Korean-style dumplings will now be a permanent fixture in my freezer.

            The reviews are all over the place, so I was a bit hesitant when I saw a huge line out the door. Oh wells - let&#39;s go for it!It wasn&#39;t bad at all! My friend and I shared a Salmon Samba and a Sumo Crunch. Both were great, but I think I liked the Sumo Crunch more. It was packed with crab (fake, but good) and one piece of shrimp tempura. The sushirritos were pretty big, but I didn&#39;t feel disgustingly full after eating one, unlike a typical visit to its possible Western equivalent: Chipotle.I definitely want to come back and try the Geisha&#39;s Kiss; I had a bite of my friends and I NEED MORE!

            Pancakes all day!? HELL YEAH!We dropped by for dinner on a Saturday night and the place was pretty much deserted, so there wasn&#39;t any wait. But deserted doesn&#39;t mean this place doesn&#39;t DELIVER. We all enjoyed everything we ordered. The Buttermilk Pancakes were soft and moist. The Swedish Pancakes were also great, especially the lingonberry butter. Regardless of what pancakes I get next time, I&#39;m definitely going to ask for a side of lingonberry butter. The only real disappointment here was the Biscuits and Gravy. An English Muffin is not a biscuit! A biscuit is a biscuit.

            Every restaurant that bakes and fries sushi as if they invented it should cower in fear when they find out I love Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose, because NOBODY does it better. Yet I can&#39;t help but go into this type of restaurant every time expecting a Cha Cha-level experience.Unfortunately, this place just can&#39;t compare. The rolls are priced similarly, but that&#39;s where the similarities end. The rolls are much smaller, and the WOW factor just isn&#39;t there. My dining partner enjoyed the Kentucky Roll, which has fried chicken -- but I mean, how wrong can you go with fried chicken. I enjoyed the creamy Sexy Roll. The Fried Cheese appetizer was also decadent. The service was extremely friendly, and unlike most places in San Francisco, this place is open until 2 AM. If I&#39;m hankering for untraditional sushi and in the city, I would probably go to Ryoko&#39;s again. But if I want a truly amazing dining experience, I&#39;ll make the trek down to Cha Cha in San Jose.

            Sounds like an interesting idea - a Mexican and Korean comfort food fusion joint. Yet, the result isn&#39;t anything spectacular. Not bad, but also not great. My Kimchi Burrito with Bulgogi was exactly that - a burrito with kimchi and bulgogi beef. I was hoping for juicier bulgogi, and a more powerful mix of flavors that would make me reconsider how two countries separated by a vast ocean could have cuisines that could ever blend together. But I wasn&#39;t so divinely inspired during my meal. Oh wells...

            Not the greatest cookies or ice cream in the world, but for only $2.50 you can&#39;t help but feel like a total winner.

            Nirvanaah serves Indian ice cream that HAS to be legit because my friends and I were the only non-Indian people when we dropped by. They have a ton of flavors, and everyone in line with us and the servers behind the counter were happy to help us navigate the flavor lineup.I went with the Paan because the server told me every bite &#34;drives him absolutely crazy.&#34; The flavor was powerful, multi-faceted, and reminded me of those seeds you eat on your way out of an Indian restaurant. The Mango flavor tasted like they froze a Mango Lassi. The Apple Custard Pie flavor was pretty good too. I definitely need to come here again because I only covered a small portion of their flavors.

            Marlowe offers up amazing food, with a side of amazing service.Did I mention? The food was AMAZING. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to share and a Marlowe Burger. Our server (also the bartender) told us what order our stuff would come out in; turns out everything we ordered roughly equated to a three-course meal. He even split up items like the soup so we could both gluttonously dive in without worrying about our dining partner&#39;s share.We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered: Warm Deviled Eggs, Baked Oysters, Roasted Bone Marrow, and the Marlowe Burger. The Marlowe Burger deserves a special shout-out for being one of the most amazing burgers I&#39;ve ever had. And it was also cooked exactly as I requested. It&#39;s really amazing biting into a burger cooked rare! So, so, so juicy! Dessert impressed as well. The Upside Down Strawberry Crisp and the TCHO Chocolate Cream Pie closed out a wonderful meal. My dining partner and I were sitting at the end of the bar. A friend joined us halfway through our meal. I was worried we were going to get hassled for blocking the passage between the dining hall and the kitchen. Instead, we found the staff offering us another stool for the friend to sit next to us.

            An awesome little ramen joint that is worth checking out. My Yakisoba Ramen was on point. The soy-based broth was flavorful without being too salty, and the noodles were on point. The only thing that could&#39;ve been done better were the other toppings: I felt like I was eating ONLY noodles in broth for 90% of my meal. That said, I&#39;ll come here again if I&#39;m in the area and craving ramen. I love the hole-in-the-wall seating arrangement here. There are just a bunch of long tables, so it might not be great for large groups, as you will all be sitting in a straight line. That said, someone in my group mentioned wanting some fried rice and the stranger next to us offered to share his because the portion was too large for one person. Now that&#39;s MAGIC.Also, there&#39;s complimentary kimchi and awesome barley tea!

            Decent frozen yogurt with a nice selection of flavors. I sampled the Vanilla, Peanut Butter, Cheesecake, Blueberry, and Strawberry flavors and was all-around impressed with the texture and taste. As expected of things in San Francisco, you&#39;ll pay for more than you get, but if you check in on Yelp, you can get a 10% discount off your entire order!

            The Black Milk Bubble Tea was okay: a bit too tart (very coffee-like) for my tastes. I can see why some people might be put off by it. But if the bubble tea doesn&#39;t impress you, this place packs another one-two punch. Their fruit smoothies and candy selection is awesome. My Blueberry Smoothie (made with REAL blueberries) was awesome. My friend&#39;s Papaya Smoothie (made with REAL papaya) was equally awesome. And I was able to get some SWEDISH FISH!

            YES! Three Twins Ice Cream is amazing. The only difficult part is choosing which flavors you want because pretty much everything sounds and is amazing. I went with Vanilla and Strawberry in a Waffle Cone, and it was amazing. I can&#39;t recommend Three Twins enough. Luckily, they sell their ice cream at Whole Foods so I can, for better or worse, ALWAYS get my fix!

            A 100% gluten-free bakery. The Creme Br√ªl√©e Cheesecake is pricey ($6.25 a slice), but you&#39;ll need at least two people to even attempt to tackle this rich chunk of cheesecake. The cookies are nothing special. I asked my sister, the gluten-free aficionado in the family, what she thought about this place. She says Mariposa Bakery is way better than Cate &amp; Co. Sorry Cate. For what it&#39;s worth, Mariposa doesn&#39;t make awesome slices of cheesecake yet!

Kara&#39;s Cupcakes does offer gluten-free cupcakes, which are always bound to please anyone with gluten sensitives. Choose wisely and you&#39;ll be happy with Kara&#39;s Cupcakes!

            Pica Pica is 100% gluten-free and reminds me of the iconic Pok√©mon: PIKACHU!!!The Arepas are delicious. I had Pulled Pork Pernil Arepa, and my sister and friend had the Grilled Chicken Arepas. We all agreed that the pork one was superior. The Yuca Fries are also good... all 6 of them in the order! The price isn&#39;t outrageous given this place is in a fancy downtown Napa food court, and the portion sizes are reasonable. Fortunately, there are plenty of places to get dessert within eyesight!

            I&#39;m really torn about Minako. So many things were great, but at the same time, there were some serious shortcomings.GREAT - The menu is amazing for people with gluten allergies or people who hate meat or animal-derived products. GOOD - The service is great; the staff is so friendly and willing to walk you through every question you have. OKAY - Unfortunately, the food is JUST okay. Nothing really stood out and blew us away. Among everything we had, the Corn Tempura and Chicken Katsu stood out as better than the rest. BAD - The price for our meal was pretty steep. Our wallets left a lot lighter and our stomachs not much fuller (read: we were still hungry). I don&#39;t mind dropping money when the food is great. Yet, I felt somewhat jipped as we left Minako.In short, wonderful service and great for people with special dietary concerns, but the food won&#39;t be amazing and you will pay dearly.

They have plenty of delicious baked goods, including a nice selection of gluten-free options, that are in their own gluten-free display case! The gluten-free Banana Bread was large, moist, and packed with flavor. The Peanut Butter Cookie would&#39;ve been better if it didn&#39;t have quinoa, but it wouldn&#39;t be very hip without it.

            Simple, but well-executed teriyaki dishes. They make all their teriyaki glazes from scratch, and even offer a gluten-free glaze. My only complaint is that you pay nearly $10 for a salad, two scoops of rice, and a meager amount of meat. Yes, it&#39;s San Francisco, so I never expect my dollar to go very far.

            Radish is a really awesome brunch joint. Make a reservation because this isn&#39;t a hidden gem; if you show up without a reservation, you will probably need to wait.My dining party enjoyed everything we ordered. I was stuck between the Shrimp Po&#39; boy and the Pancakes, and ended up going with the po&#39; boy. It was good, but in retrospect, I should&#39;ve gone with the pancakes because they looked REAL GOOD. They also offer gluten-free options for most of their items. And to compliment your amazing meal, you probably will be able to scope out some SF-bros pounding bottomless mimosas. And I can&#39;t forget to mention that you&#39;ll be dining in the BEST city in the universe with the BEST people in the universe!

Aside from the traditional savory and sweet crepes most other creperies offer, Blossom Bee also makes crepes stuffed with Thai curries! My Massaman Crepe was off the freaking hook! The side of Potato Soup was also delicious. This place is so good, I might just make the occasional pilgrimage to Dublin for some DELICIOUS and unique crepes.

My sister enjoyed her Steak Frites and my Chicken Breast dish (with creamy mashed potatoes) was pretty awesome too. The dishes themselves may be considered a tad overpriced, but we were both fully satisfied with our dining experience. For those with gluten sensitivities, they can prepare most items on their menu without gluten!

It&#39;s pricey, but so very, very solid.The Dressed Lobster Roll was tasty and classy (Read: not drenched in mayonnaise). The lobster was good, but the bread was also awesome. My only complaint is that for $17.50, I was hoping for a little more lobster. It&#39;s high-quality lobster, but it would&#39;ve been nice to get a little more. That said, I&#39;m DEFINITELY coming back here. Up next -- their Dungeness Crab Roll!

            My dining partner and I came here to celebrate an anniversary. What a treat it was! We really enjoyed our visit.The Crab Cake and Cream of Broccoli and Chicken Soup got things started off on a high note, although the Crab Cake would eventually be the low point of an otherwise wonderful evening. The Steak Diane Flambe, which is cooked right in front of you, is covered in some DELICIOUS sauce. The massive and juicy Ribeye Steak kept my dining partner (and eventually me) occupied for a while. For dessert, the Souffl√© (chocolate for her, mixed berries for me), was awesome. Our server, Carlos, was awesome. He was always around when we needed him, kindly answered any questions we had, and was the cherry on top of our awesome time at The Iron Gate.

            They do some Harry Potter-esque magic with liquid nitrogen to make the smoothest ice cream I&#39;ve ever had. That said, besides the novelty of ice cream made in your face, there are plenty of downsides, which makes me hesitant to come back. It takes time to make, they are slow, the flavor selection isn&#39;t extensive, it&#39;s expensive, and you can&#39;t get more than one flavor.Worst of all, their waffle cones have holes in the bottom. I&#39;m paying an arm and a leg to have ice cream dripping all over the floor. Such sadness!

            The bubbles in the bubble tea are pretty good, but the tea itself is pretty mediocre.But where Quickly truly shines is with their amazing line-up of Asian-style snacks. Everything I&#39;ve tried, I&#39;ve liked. The Popcorn Chicken rocks, the Potstickers are crispy, the Cheese Spam Musubi is awesome, and the Pop Dogs are ridiculously and ingeniously amazing. Even though I always consume a ton of fried food when I visit Quickly, I still feel like a champ afterwards.

            ABC Bakery Cafe is good, but it&#39;s like a lesser version of Cafe Salina in Millbrae. The menu is large, but not as large as Salina&#39;s. The food is good, but not as good as Salina&#39;s. The waiters are cool, but not as cool as Salina&#39;s. It&#39;s got one thing going for it: it&#39;s open later than Cafe Salina.But if you held a gun to my head and told me to point you to the best Hong Kong style cuisine place in the area, ABC is not it.

            It&#39;s come to the point where every time I get bubble tea at some place other than Sharetea, I REGRET IT. Sharetea is the bomb, and it has definitely earned 5 star recognition.The tea is consistently great, plenty of boba is given, and the staff is friendly. I love, love, LOVE the Okinawa Bubble Tea. The Hokkaido Milk Tea is great, as is the QQ Family Special if you&#39;re into all sorts of toppings. Sorry Tpumps -- Sharetea is the BEST bubble tea place in town!

            Great burger, hot dogs, and fries. I went with the Mini (only one burger patty instead of two) Bacon Cheeseburger and a Bacon Cheese Hot Dog. Both were great. I tried both the Cajun and Regular Fries and definitely enjoyed the slightly spicy Cajun ones more.In the eternal duel, I prefer In-N-Out, but my friend likes Five Guys more. Today, we can all be winners -- they both serve great burgers.

            I was excited when I finally made it over to the Easy Bay to check this place out. While everything was okay, nothing really impressed anyone in my party. When I asked what everyone&#39;s favorite item was, no one felt anything was deserving of the honor of being &#34;a favorite.&#34;Case in point -- the Pork Buns. The steamed ones were good, but could have used a little more meat. The baked ones were cold. I love Pork Buns, but not these.

            Great Korean food across the board once you can find it. It&#39;s in Seoul Plaza - a little complex that you can drive into. Jang Mo Jip is in suite 100 which is right inside the arch you drive through to get to all the other stores inside the plaza.The Mandu (fried potstickers) was exceptionally crispy. The Seafood Pancake was one of the best I&#39;ve had. The Fried Chicken was juicy and drenched in that bright-red-yet-not-super-spicy red sauce. Would definitely come here again if I were craving more than Korean Fried Chicken. If I just want chicken, 99 Chicken across the street still serves the best damn fried chicken in town.

            My friends and I got some take-out from here. The Banchan (set of appetizers) was good; I really enjoyed the rice noodles and kimchi. The Mandu (fried dumplings) were also good. The Seafood Pancake was more eggy than usual and reminded me of a frittata. The BBQ Pork Bibimbap was good, but had a very meager amount of meat.

The bread is so light, fluffy, and filled with cream. Every bite is a bite of heaven!In addition to their wonderful milk bread, they also do a bunch of other amazing things. Anything with a sausage in it is likely to blow your mind. Their Blueberry Cream Cheese Bread is also amazing. They also make decent bubble tea.AHHHHH!!!! I LOVE IT! I WANT IT! I NEED IT NOW!

            Sheng Kee offers a decent selection of baked goods. In general, things range from mediocre to pretty good. Here are some highlights: - Baked BBQ Pork Bun - In my humble opinion, the true test of a Chinese bakery. The ones at Sheng Kee are good: soft bread, lots of juicy meat, and large. I ate three in one day and that made my day pretty awesome.- Portuguese Custard Tart - I grew up eating the best Portuguese Custard Cups in the world at Teixeira&#39;s Bakery in Newark, NJ. The ones at Sheng Kee are good, but I wouldn&#39;t cry tears of joy at the sight of them. Yes, I&#39;m a snob. Yes, I&#39;m Portuguese. So take my word for it.- Cream Cheese Toast - I love cream cheese, so I bought some sliced cream cheese toast bread. The cream cheese isn&#39;t evenly spread throughout the entire loaf, so some bites are awesome, but most are just average.- Blueberry Cream Cheese Pastry - Awesome! Soft, flaky crust filled with a good amount of blueberry jam and cream cheese.

            A cute, quaint, mom-and-pop, hole-in-the-wall Filipino brunch joint. The food isn&#39;t fancy, but it definitely hits the spot. The breakfast combos get you meat, garlic fried rice, and ¬†two eggs prepared however you like them. I enjoyed my Hotsilog (hot dog) and my dining partner enjoyed the Longsilog (sweet sausage). My only complaint is the garlic fried rice didn&#39;t really taste as garlicky as I was hoping for.

            Woah! This place is awesome! Start to finish, my dining party was impressed. We all left happy, although a little uncomfortably full of the delicious food that we weren&#39;t able to resist.The Shubnum Curry (Vegetable/Navaratan Korma) was some of the best I&#39;ve had. The Saag Panner and Malai Kofta were also spot on. The Cheese Naan, served with some tikki masala sauce, was to die for. In short, this is some seriously good Indian food.On top of all this, the service was fast and friendly. Once again, San Carlos is proving to be a real hotbed of great cuisine in the Bay Area.

            This place is DOPE! From start to finish, absolute greatness was delivered to our table. The Lamb Samosa appetizer was great. The Vegetable Korma and Chicken Makhani were hits. In general, the food had a bit of kick to it, but it was never too spicy. The Mango and Cashew Indian Ice Cream sealed the deal on our great meal. I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m saying this, given the somewhat shady neighborhood, but I actually want to come back!

            This Jersey boy is far from home, but Jersey Joe&#39;s took me back to my hoagie-pounding days in Dirty Jersey. Let&#39;s start with appetizers. The Chili Cheese Fries were totally on point. The Mozzarella Sticks were good. Next time, I&#39;ll pass on the Jalape√±o Poppers. I was hoping for them to be filled with cream cheese, but was disappointed to find them filled cheese whiz instead.The star of the show did not disappoint. My Cheesesteak with peppers, onions, and mushrooms was awesome. I was worried about the amount of cheese given some of the reviews here. When I got my hoagie, I really couldn&#39;t see any cheese. But every bite had a magical infusion of cheese, so my worries quickly disappeared.Also, they have a ton of cool Jersey, Philly signs and swags. There is some San Francisco stuff too, but we all know San Francisco can&#39;t ever roll EAST COAST STYLE.

            My company had a small party here to celebrate the new year. I&#39;m no connoisseur of alcohol, but the amount and variety of whiskey here was impressive; shelves upon shelves of whiskey with a sliding ladder to access even higher shelves.The hors d&#39;oeuvre were awesome. The Pork Belly Cracklings, Fried Chicken Bites with Waffle and Pepper Jelly, and Andouille Sausage Grits with Spicy Slaw were my favorites. I&#39;d come back for some more of these tasty dishes.Caveat - no bathroom in the actual establishment. You need to use the public restroom that&#39;s outside and around the corner. It&#39;s clean, so I won&#39;t knock it too much.

            For deep-fried and baked sushi goodness, Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose is the best and Yokohama in Redwood City sits comfortably in second. After a visit to Monster Sushi, the line-up hasn&#39;t changed because Monster Sushi gets the Bronze Medal of Deep-Fried Sushi Goodness.The deep-fried North and South (eel, crab, green onion) was pretty good, but then again - when isn&#39;t a ball of fried rice awesome? The two baked rolls we tried - the Lion King and Victoria&#39;s Secret - were very underwhelming. The fish didn&#39;t taste fresh and the most prominent flavor in each was plain old rice. The Jalape√±o Bombs were good, but not nearly as good as the ones at Cha Cha Sushi. In short, it&#39;s JUST OKAY, but you can DEFINITELY do better if you&#39;re willing to drive a bit.

            +1 for a RIDICULOUSLY AWESOME Crab Melt sandwich that is supposedly made with REAL crab. I say supposedly because it&#39;s large, yet cheap ($8.99) given how expensive crab is. +1 for serving large slices of pizza. One of their slices is like two slices anywhere else. If you don&#39;t plan accordingly, don&#39;t worry - pizza reheats really well. +1 for offering whole wheat and gluten-free crusts. +1 for being open late (11 PM) relative to all the other restaurants in the area.-1 for calling itself New York Pizza but being no where near the quality of pizza you can get in NYC. It&#39;s not terrible, but it doesn&#39;t really stand out either.

            Alexander&#39;s serves up pricey food, but it&#39;s worth the price and you won&#39;t have to deal with unneeded snobbery that oftentimes accompanies pricey restaurants. Their steaks are awesome. My medium-rare 10 oz. Filet Mignon was bloody amazing. The Butternut Squash Soup appetizer was also wonderful. To top off your expensive meal, and to make sure you never think this place is TOO FANCY, you&#39;ll be served some complimentary cotton candy at the end!

            This hole-in-the-wall restaurant sports a gimmicky name, but dishes out some seriously good dim sum cuisine. The Shanghai Steamed Dumplings were filled with a ridiculous amount of juicy broth. The Pork and Chive Dumplings and Pork Pot Stickers were also great. The Beef Pancake was also one of the best I&#39;ve tasted. Unfortunately, the Green Onion Pancake was really bland, and ended up being the only disappointing item.+1 for having only one lady working the entire front end, who still manages to have a friendly disposition!

            Not going to lie - Taiwanese cuisine just isn&#39;t my favorite style of Chinese cuisine. I really prefer Cantonese-style food above all others. While the authentic Taiwanese cuisine served here isn&#39;t my cup of tea, all the food was fresh and impressed my friends who are more familiar with the cuisine (i.e. my Asian friends). What I did enjoy was the Shaved Ice. We tried the Milk, Taro, and Mango-flavored shaved ice. All of them were awesome. I couldn&#39;t decide whether I liked the Taro or Mango flavor better.

            My friend was so excited to bring me here; she had Garlic Noodles during her first visit and loved them. After our most recent visit, her enthusiasm for Attic has diminished quite significantly. The Sweet Potato Fries with Banana Ketchup were pretty good and my friend enjoyed the Bone Marrow dish. The Sizzling Sisig was a major disappointment. The meat was too chewy and tasted old. We got it with an egg and our waiter told us to flip it over to let it cook on the &#34;really hot&#34; serving plate. We waited for a while, but our egg was never close to cooking itself. The Kimchee Fried Rice was okay, but nothing mind-blowing.Looks like the menu is filled with great items and not-so-great items. Tread carefully, friends!

            A SUPER SOLID dim sum place in Chinatown. We tried 18 things and were generally impressed with everything that came out. Some things worth noting:* Pan-Fried Pork Buns - This was actually the only thing that really disappointed everyone. It was just blah - the bread didn&#39;t really feel pan-fried and the meat inside was bland.* Golden Pumpkin Fries - Not as good as the ones at Champagne Restaurant (Millbrae), but still stand-out and pretty damn amazing. Parking is also surprisingly easy for San Francisco. Park in the Portsmouth Square Garage on Kearny Street. Bring your parking ticket with you as most restaurants, including this one, will validate it (gives you two free hours). At $3 an hour, even if you spend some additional time in Chinatown, you won&#39;t be getting ripped off.

            A nice little hole-in-the-wall Chinese place that dishes out good dumplings and dim sum dishes. In general, we enjoyed everything we ordered. The Shanghai Soup Dumplings were really, really good. So good that they are competing for the top position in my soup dumpling book. On the other hand, the Green Onion Pancake was really flavorless, and tasted like cardboard. Yuck!I buy frozen dumplings from here and cook them at home in a vegetable steamer. It&#39;s a great system as I get to have amazing dumplings at any time!

            This place is awesome. It does authentic Japanese stuff well and even does some more Americanized stuff, which I&#39;m a big fan of. The 81 Allendale (salmon, crab, avocado, CREAM CHEESE, asparagus, katsu crunch) is far from authentic, but it&#39;s DAMN EPIC. On the other end of authenticity, the Nabeyaki Udon (with a side of delicious Inari Sushi) was also amazing. Every time I come here, regardless of what I try, I&#39;m impressed. GG Masa.

            I first fell in love with Tous Les Jours during a summer in South Korea; the Pure Milk Cream Bread had me at first bite. There were Tous Les Jours in the USA, but unfortunately none in the Bay Area where I live. Fortunately, this love story has a happy ending -- I discovered recently with great joy that there&#39;s a Tous Les Jours near my parent&#39;s house!The one true gem is the Pure Milk Bread. It&#39;s everything I want in a bun: soft, sweet bread filled with a good amount of light, and evenly distributed cream. The Pink Milk Bread puts a strawberry twist on this delightful bun. The Blueberry Cream Cheese Bread is another winner: a bit more rigid than the soft bun of the Milk Bread, but filled with some awesome blueberry cream cheese that has whole blueberries in it!I can&#39;t lie, I can&#39;t hide it, and I can&#39;t deny it... I love you, Tous Les Jours. Now please come to the Bay Area so I can have you ALL THE TIME!

            Awesome macarons. Friendly staff. Gluten-free, yet still delicious.I learned during a recent visit that the Speculos-Raspberry flavor contains gluten. Earlier in the month, I purchased some of these at the San Francisco store unaware that they contained gluten. Fortunately, my sister is allergic -- but not deathly allergic -- to gluten.

            During a recent visit to South Korea (the less cool one), I fell in love with Tous Les Jours: a Korean Bakery dishing out some wonderfully decadent baked goods. In particular, I fell in love with the delicious Milk Cream Bread. There aren&#39;t any Tous Les Jours in the Bay Area, but there are Paris Baguettes (also a Korean bakery) so I dropped by looking for the cream bread.I was hoping Paris Baguette would stock it, but every time I come in, they never seem to have them. The closest I&#39;ve gotten is Chocolate Cream Bread, but I despise chocolate. I still enjoy my visits because they have a bunch of different items that are enjoyable, but nothing ever really wows me like that bread at Tous Les Jours did. Here&#39;s to hoping one day I can hit the jackpot and Tous Les Jours opens a bakery nearby!

            After one visit, MaMa Ji&#39;s has made a really great first impression. Everything we got was good. Out of the feast we ordered, I really enjoyed the Fried Pumpkin with Egg Yolk, the Seafood Shumai, and the massive Pan-Fried Pot Stickers. My dining partner loved their Crispy Eggplant. If you want something green, try the Stir Fried Pea Leaves in Garlic Sauce.As always, I got some Steamed BBQ Pork Buns; the bread was soft, but there could&#39;ve been more pork inside. The Shanghai Dumplings were good, but not the best I&#39;ve had in the Bay Area (that prize goes to Panda Dumpling in San Carlos). Dessert was awesome. My dining party really enjoyed their Seared Pumpkin Cake. They also serve cookies from Black Jet Bakery: my friend was into their Oreo Cookies and I devoured a delicious Peanut Butter cookie and a Granola with Cream cookie. In short, tons of enjoyment from start to finish. Thanks, MaMa Ji&#39;s!

            This place is awesome...a bit TOO AWESOME in fact.You&#39;ll get the urge to dig into their wonderful cheesy bread, fried plantains, and everything the sidebar has to offer, but that&#39;s all just filler for the real prize: MEAT. LOTS OF IT. I&#39;m never disappointed with the selection of meats Pampas offers; during my most recent visit, I was QUITE taken with the coriander-laced Pork Loin and marinated Beef Tenderloin Filet Tips. Also, during the holiday season, you can get rodizio FOR LUNCH! Save some room for dessert because it comes with the meal, and my Coconut Flan wasn&#39;t half bad!

            I like the idea behind the Ice Cream Bar: a retro place where you can get sundaes, floats, alcoholic ice cream drinks, and traditional ice cream in a cone. But at the end of the day, the entire experience falls short of amazing.I got a Keller&#39;s Farm Sundae (cornmeal shortbread, creme fraiche ice cream, morello cherry ice cream, cherry sauce and rosemary syrup) and it was awesome. I&#39;m not normally a big fan of cherry-flavored ice cream, but their Morello Cherry ice cream had me hooked. Then I tried their Brioche Bread Pudding. Yuck! The thing was too freaking sweet. The bread pudding itself was squishy and didn&#39;t really have any flavor that I could pick out from the suffocating wave of sugar.I give them three stars because they are walking off the beaten path when it comes to ice cream. If you can dodge their duds, this place isn&#39;t half bad!

            We ordered mostly cooked food and were not disappointed. The Great Balls of Fire was good. The decadent Kobe Beef Roll melted in my mouth, although my dining partner didn&#39;t really care for the ginger garnish. The Hanabi Roll (California Roll topped with baked salmon) was also awesome. The Butabara (Pork Belly) Skewer was juicy and tender. The Kani Korokke (crab croquettes) were super creamy -- a GREAT thing in my book. ¬†The food definitely earned four stars; we enjoyed everything we ordered. Yet at the end of the day, the price-to-wow ratio was too low. Everything was really pricey, the portions were rather small, and the food was good, but didn&#39;t blow us away -- so minus a star.

            $6.50 for a slice of cake? Yes, but this place does not serve you mere slices of cake; the portions are MASSIVE. Like, 1/6th of a cake per slice. Like, bring friends because you don&#39;t want all the guilt that comes with eating even ONE of their servings.My Banana Fresh cake was good: three layers of Banana Bread Cake with whipped cream in between each layer. The whipped cream was awesome and the banana bread was good, but nothing spectacular. Same goes for my friend who got the Black Forest Chocolate Cake; good, but nothing amazing. I got a Peanut Butter Cookie too and that was pretty good. Shout-out to the guy behind the counter - Davin - who was friendly, funny, and helped us navigate the myriad of cakes we had to pick from.

            The Euphoria burger was aptly named as it provided an absolutely euphoric experience. Every bite just melted in my mouth. The horseradish aioli contributed a lot to the creamy texture and rich flavor. The grass-fed beef patty itself was juicy and flavorful. The side of fries were pretty decent too.I&#39;ll definitely be coming back to Bierhaus to try their other burgers.

            Butter Corn - This dish made me feel like I was at some Japanese temple training to be a samurai because eating corn with chopsticks is an EXERCISE IN PATIENCE. But you can&#39;t really complain when what you&#39;re working for happens to be corn lathered in butter, sprinkled with chunks of bacon.Takoyaki - Your standard piping hot, fried octopus balls.Sausage with Cheese Sauce - This dish was cool: four spicy sausages lathered in mozzarella cheese. ¬†I thought the fun was over once we ate all the sausages, but the cheese stuck to the bottom of the pan began to crisp, yielding delicious results. Roku&#39;s Okonomiyaki - We came here because my dining partner was craving this exact dish. It was good, but it would have been nice to get some more sauce on it because towards the end, I was just eating the cabbage plain. Tonpei Yaki - An omelette with pork, cabbage, and topped with mustard and mayonnaise? YES, PLEASE. Really delicious dish!Deep-Fried Swimming Crab Legs - Gah! I was hoping this dish didn&#39;t come with the shell still on the crab legs because I hate working for my food. Even though the shell was soft enough after frying to just eat, I wasn&#39;t feeling it. Fortunately, my dining partner is a hard-working eater and took care of all the legs.

            Yokohama isn&#39;t quite on the level of Cha Cha in San Jose, but it&#39;s much closer to where I live and they do a pretty good job with their cooked rolls.Pork Gyoza - This gyoza has the most crispy shell I&#39;ve ever had... And I didn&#39;t mind at all!Special California Roll (real crab, avocado) - A California Roll with REAL crab. The real, shredded crab gives this roll a unique texture, but aside from that it&#39;s just the Plain Jane of sushi rolls. Overall, the roll could do with a little more crab. T.N.T. Roll (spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalape√±o, deep fried) - PARTY&#39;S HERE! One DAMN GOOD deep-fried roll that was on par with what I expect of Cha Cha!Volcano Roll (spicy scallop, with more scallop) - I was expecting something cooked, but what we got was a mountain of scallop (the volcano) surrounded by a simple fresh roll with some spicy red sauce. It wasn&#39;t bad, but definitely didn&#39;t blow me away.Lion King (crab meat, avocado, baked salmon, tobiko, spicy mayo sauce) - This roll just melts in your mouth. Comparable with Cha Cha&#39;s except you get less baked salmon on top; I wouldn&#39;t mind paying for more salmon to do this roll some TRUE JUSTICE.Mochi Ice Cream - We got all four flavors they had that evening: Chocolate, Green Tea, Strawberry, and Mango. My favorite was Strawberry, hers was Chocolate. Neither of us cared much for the Green Tea which, oddly enough, tasted kind of soapy. Green Tea Ice Cream - Unlike the Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream, this ice cream was a much better at executing on its green tea flavor. Not too sweet and a bit bitter, but that&#39;s what you expect of Green Tea Ice Cream.In short - I&#39;ll be back and I&#39;m going to focus on their cooked and fried rolls because there&#39;s a lot of potential for an amazing meal here.

            - Decent gluten-free sandwiches. My sister and I shared a Meatball Sandwich and a Church Square Chicken Parm. We enjoyed them both, and the gluten-free bread didn&#39;t fall apart!- The Church Square Chicken Parm Sandwich isn&#39;t really chicken parmesan since the chicken isn&#39;t fried; it&#39;s just a piece of grilled chicken with tomato sauce. - $2.50 surcharge for gluten-free sandwiches. This shop was established because the owner&#39;s son is super sensitive to gluten and he wanted a place where his son could eat without worrying. Not sure if he wants his son to live in a world where there is a 25% fee for having an allergy.- No seating inside. They used to have it, but fire regulations did away with it. Kind of disappointing for those who drive into town for a gluten-free sandwich in the winter, but have to wait until they get home to enjoy it.

            When moving out of Newark, one thing my family and I were all going to miss was the amazing churrasqueiras: BBQ joints known for pumping out amazing barbecue chicken. Fortunately, Somerset County has a Churrasqueira Champion in 28 BBQ.It&#39;s the trifecta of amazing: the food is great, the servings are large, and the price is reasonable. My family digs their BBQ Chicken, Pork Cutlets, and BBQ Short Ribs. These all come with a side of yellow rice (with a few veggies here and there), and fries or beans. While everything mentioned above is awesome, my favorite dish is their Cheesesteak Sandwich. It&#39;s not Philly-style where the meat is minced into small pieces. Here, you&#39;ll get a thin, whole piece of steak that packs a lot of wonderful smoky BBQ flavor. The cheese, onions, peppers, and soft bread make every bite decadent. The only thing that could make this bad boy better is if they served it on a Portuguese Roll instead of the generic bun they use. Thanks, 28 BBQ, for delivering some DELICIOUS Portuguese food.

            Decent bubble tea: not too sweet, comes with a good amount of super chewy boba, and they don&#39;t pack it with tons of ice.They have macarons too, but these were disappointing. They keep them chilled so you can&#39;t enjoy them then and there because they are best eaten at room temperature. Even after waiting for them to warm up, the macarons were like Oreos: two crunchy cookies with filling in between. In short - go for the bubble tea, skip the macarons.

            When we moved from Newark to Bridgewater, I was dreading having to drive longer distances to go shopping. Fortunately, Bridgewater has an awesome mall right in town, and it has everything I need: a movie theatre, a food court, a Gamestop to satisfy my gaming addiction, an Express when I need a new wardrobe, and an Apple Store for when my gadgets kick the bucket. Just outside the mall is a Chipotle and a Best Buy in case you are a true American, and need a massive burrito or an even more massive electronics store.

            Whenever I visit home, Portugalia is the restaurant my family goes to for our meal out. The food is authentically Portuguese and delicious. If you dine at the bar or restaurant while there&#39;s a soccer game, you&#39;ll even get a side of Portuguese guys yelling at the TV.I love the Mini Prego: a thin slice of beef on a mini bun. With such soft bread, and juicy, tender meat, it&#39;s my go-to appetizer. You can&#39;t go wrong with the daily specials. If you&#39;re coming with a bunch of people, you can order a bunch of entrees and share. There will likely still be leftovers because their portions are MASSIVE.Dessert leaves something to be desired. They prepare everything in the morning and then keep it all refrigerated. It&#39;s not bad, but it won&#39;t blow you away. I&#39;d skip dessert here and just grab a Pastel de Nata at Teixeira&#39;s around the corner.

            You add the &#34;√£o&#34; suffix to Portuguese words to describe huge things. The burger here could just be called a &#34;hamburga,&#34; but that doesn&#39;t quite do these burgers justice. Because Hamburg√£o&#39;s burgers are, quite simply, incredibly large and in charge. Whenever I&#39;m back home, I always make a point to stop by Hamburg√£o for my &#34;large burger&#34; fix.I always go with the trusty Cheese Tudo: burger patty, mozzarella, ham, bacon, fried egg, potato sticks, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, and corn. This thing is massive, and costs under seven bucks to boot! The meat is cooked well-done so it can be a little dry, but the burger itself is still decadent. If I want to punish my stomach, I also get a Coxinha. Imagine a pear, but filled with chicken and deep-fried.

            Who has two thumbs and wins the Big Brother of the Year Award for trucking a 24-pack of Chantal Guillon&#39;s awesome macarons across the country for his sister? *points at self with both thumbs* THIS GUY.Aside from tasting awesome, they&#39;re 100% gluten-free too. My sister&#39;s favorites are Hazelnut, Dark Chocolate, Red Velvet, Coffee, and Salted Caramel. She really didn&#39;t like the Almond Amaretto and Italian Pistachio. If you&#39;re getting these for someone else, ask them for the plastic cases. The case did a great job keeping everything in immaculate form, even when I put it in my carry-on luggage.

            Ice cream, and cookies, and licorice! Oh my!The ice cream here is top notch. My triple scoop of Malted Milk, Vanilla Bean, and Pumpkin was an adventure in pleasantly subdued flavors. I particularly enjoyed the Malted Milk flavor. While the Peanut Brittle and Brown Sugar Cookie didn&#39;t provide the flavor I was hoping, my cookie-eating partner says Mr. and Mrs. Miscellaneous makes some of the best Chocolate Chip Cookies he has EVER had. She also really enjoyed the Sour Cherry licorice stick.In short - this place is a TRIPLE THREAT ice cream joint! Come prepared to enjoy ice cream and many of the other goodies they offer.

            We order Mac and Cheese from Homeroom in Oakland for Smule Thanksgiving celebrations in San Francisco. Even though the food travels across the Bay, it doesn&#39;t lose much of its magic: this is some DAYUM GOOD mac and cheese. I never regret filling my plate with ONLY mac and cheese, and skipping everything else on the table.My favorite flavors include the extremely creamy Vermont White Cheddar, the garlicky Gilroy Garlic, and the spicy Jalape√±o Popper Mac. One day, I&#39;ll make it to Homeroom and have some fresh-out-of-the-oven mac and cheese. Tears of happiness will be shed that day.

            An OKAY brunch place. They brag about their home-made cookies on their menu, but my oily, flat, dry Oatmeal Raisin Cookie wasn&#39;t anything to brag about.

            Pretty awesome ramen joint. The Potstickers and Deep-Fried Wheat Ball with Octopus pleasantly kicked off our meal. I got a Spicy Garlic Pork broth with extra Roasted Pork and Kimchi. The &#34;Regular&#34; spicy is pretty spicy, but I managed with only a few tears. The bowls are huge and pack a good amount of noodles. The broth was awesome, as was pretty much everything else in this magnificent creation. For dessert, my dining partner and I shared some super FRESH Green Tea and Strawberry Mochi. Can&#39;t deny it, I&#39;ll be back to the dojo soon.

Their HAL 5000 Learning Computer Drink Dispenser pumps out water in a powerfully thick stream. Truly MESMERIZING.4. The pizza is okay.Bad:1. Pizza crust is a bit too thin for my liking.2. At $3.00+ a slice, I expect my pizza to wow me a bit more.3. Can&#39;t seem to get a slice that isn&#39;t slightly burnt.

            The food at Park Chow was average. My dining partner and I shared an order of Bruscetta and Wontons for our appetizers. Nothing special here. My Lamb Burger - a gyro disguised as a burger - was a unique concept, but again, nothing remarkable. My dining partner said her Veggie Burger was okay. The Pumpkin Pie and Huckleberry Cobbler for dessert was again, just okay. To beat a dead horse, everything was JUST OKAY. The big plus to Park Chow is you can bring your dog and eat out front. They have heaters so even in the cool San Francisco evenings, you&#39;ll be warm. They even brought out a bowl of water and some doggie treats for my dog. Thanks, Park Chow!

            Umami does things right. They make their awesome burgers and fries in their own kitchen, and outsource their dessert to professionals in the neighborhood. Everyone is a winner!Irish Truffle Fries - Thin fries lathered in a truffle fondue is a great start. Then add some shiitake mushrooms and large, juicy chunks of bacon and you&#39;ve got some AMAZING fries.Truffle Shiitake Royale Burger - Cooked medium rare, it was oozing with juice and flavor. The onions, shiitake, and truffle glaze took this burger to next level to make this a DAYUM GOOD BURGER.Maple Pecan Bacon Pie - They get their pies from Butter Love Bakeshop. I need to visit that bakery ASAP because this pie was off the hook! To top it off, it came with a scoop of Pumpkin Spice ice cream from Humphry Slocombe.Ice Cream Sandwich - Got some Secret Breakfast from Humphry Slocombe in between two home-made White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies. Funnily enough: the one thing Umami did themselves - the cookies - were a bit underwhelming. They definitely have the right idea relying on the local dessert professionals, so here&#39;s to hoping they ¬†find a great cookie shop and use their cookies moving forward!

            Vault 164 in a nutshell: great food, average desserts, and poor execution.Warm Lump Crab &amp; Artichoke Dip with Taro Chips - Awesome appetizer. The creamy dip was piping hot and came with chunky morsels of crab meat. V164 BBQ Burger with White Cheddar - A great burger where every ingredient - chile peppers, onions, white cheddar, BBQ sauce - came together harmoniously. Also, the grilled brioche was a pleasant departure from the traditional burger bun.Mac &amp; Cheese with Pancetta - The noodles seemed undercooked, but that might&#39;ve been because the kitchen sent my order to the wrong table... TWICE. What was supposed to be a side to my burger ended up being an appetizer served right before dessert came out. Big no-no.Curious George - I mentioned that I don&#39;t like chocolate, and wanted the Chocolate Mousse on the side. The mousse came out on the side, but this desert was still drizzled in chocolate syrup. They ended up making the dessert again, but it would&#39;ve been nice to enjoy dessert with my dining party - not after them. On top of that, the dessert itself wasn&#39;t anything amazing.Baked Alaska - The Yelp hive-mind amazes me again. My dining partner got this dessert and wished she hadn&#39;t ordered it. Yes, they light it on fire. COOL. Once you get over that, you&#39;re left with an uninspiring, flat, cold brownie topped with a scoop of Safeway ice cream.Fresh Baked Apple Pie - I had a bite of this and loved it; probably the only dish that didn&#39;t make me regret ordering dessert.

            San Francisco will take all your money and go to bed at 10 PM. Randomly enough, Milpitas has a plethora of open-late-restaurants like China Palace (open until 3 AM) that serve up awesome food that won&#39;t break the bank.Pan Fried Onion Cake - Their version of a Green Onion Pancake. Very mediocre, so I&#39;ll pass on this next time.Lamb Kabob - Tender pieces of lamb covered in spicy (very manageable) seasoning.Pot Stickers - Large, thick-skinned, packed with meat, and filled with broth. I order these every time I visit and NEVER regret it. The only thing I regret is an order ONLY has ten of these delicious morsels.Saut√©ed Beef and Pumpkin - Yes, I&#39;m addicted to Chinese dishes with pumpkin. Juicy pieces of beef and slices of the ever-so versatile pumpkin go very well together.Sesame Chicken - Tender chicken on the inside, yet crispy on the outside, drenched in some delicious sauce. Even though it&#39;s an &#34;American dish,&#34; it was pretty great. Cumin Lamb with Onions - So delicious. The lamb is tender, well-seasoned and goes great with the stir-fried pieces of onion.Also, this place is cash only - I hear it makes taxes a lot easier!

            Exactly what I expect out of HoneyBerry. Decent bubble tea - a bit too tart for my tastes, too much ice, and not the best boba in the world. The Yogurt Chip Cream Cheese Roti Bun tastes great when you can find the cream cheese inside: it isn&#39;t evenly distributed inside the bun. I wish the HoneyBerry overlords would work on their roti bun recipe, because I feel it has a lot of potential. And as always with HoneyBerry, there is a very friendly staff dishing out smiles for everyone.

            Things started off great at Godfather&#39;s Burger Lounge. The Chicken Crisps were absolutely mind-blowing: so tender and juicy. My dining partner is a bonafide Chicken Tenders guru and says these are some of the best she&#39;s ever had. The super chewy Calamari was equally impressive.Then the burgers came out. My Soprano&#39;s Ultimate Burger promised to be &#34;mouth-watering,&#34; but it was just so, so bland. The saut√©ed mushrooms, onions and bacon just didn&#39;t come through at all, and the burger patty itself didn&#39;t taste like it was seasoned. Even the server-recommended pepper jack cheese didn&#39;t add any flavor. Even worse, it came with a scant amount of the homemade Godfather&#39;s Sauce. For all this burger packed, it disappointingly tasted just like a piece of meat between two pieces of bread. My dining partner was equally disappointed with his burgers (the Director&#39;s Cut Mushroom Burger and the Philly Cheese Steak Burger respectively).Maybe I&#39;ll come back, but ONLY because those Chicken Crisps are SO DAYUM GOOD.

            The search for decent Korean food in the Bay Area hit a positive note with Arang Restaurant. The banchan (assorted appetizers) was awesome. The Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap was large, packed with meat, and provided a pleasant mix of different flavors. And to top it all off, prices are reasonable, service is friendly, it&#39;s open until 2 AM (in SF - the city that goes to sleep at 10 PM), and parking is easy since you can park in the Safeway parking lot.

            A gem for those who adhere to vegan or gluten-free diets. Here&#39;s the run-down of what my friend and I sampled:Candied Blood Orange - Great! My friend really enjoyed the large slice of blood orange dipped in delectable chocolate. Butternut Squash Cake - My favorite item. So soft and juicy I had a hard time believing this was actually gluten free.Dark Chocolate Brownie - Not really a brownie -- more like a solid chunk of fudge chocolate. We put this in the toaster for 30 seconds and the entire thing started melting immediately. It paired great with the aforementioned Butternut Squash Cake -- although once melted, it served as chocolate dip instead of chocolate cake.Dried Fig Cake - Meh -- not really good. Definitely pass on this one. Agave Banana Pudding - Large and flavorful. The agave provides a cool, although somewhat dry, glue that keeps this entire thing together.

            The Food - My Honey Chipotle Pulled Pork was pretty awesome. The artisanal bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There was a good amount of pulled pork inside. The pork had a pleasant spicy kick to it that was offset by coleslaw. That said, I was expecting my $10 to go a little farther than a modestly-sized sandwich and a small salad of mixed greens. The Wait - A bunch of coworkers and I ordered to-go. Now I don&#39;t mind waiting for food to be prepared, but when 6 out of 7 orders come out and we sit there waiting 10 minutes for the last to come out, it&#39;s kind of annoying. Especially when I&#39;m hungry and need to sit there ogling that temptress of a sandwich.

            Visit after visit, dish after dish, expectations have been met, exceeded, and I can&#39;t deny it anymore -- Cafe Salina is more than worthy of 5 STARS. I have NO complaints. They do NOTHING wrong. Trust me -- we&#39;ve tried to find weaknesses in their massive menu, but there&#39;s something truly magical happening in that kitchen. &#34;Let&#39;s order a milkshake. There&#39;s no way this Chinese joint can make those well.&#34; WRONG.&#34;This lo mein dish with pork looks kind of weird; it&#39;s probably not going to be very good. Let&#39;s test&#39;em.&#34; WRONG AGAIN.&#34;Wow this dish looks amazing. If it tastes amazing, I&#39;m definitely coming back every week for the rest of my life.&#34; YES, it&#39;s amazing. YES, I&#39;m coming back next week AGAIN AND FOREVER. I always roll in after 8 PM to avoid the crowds and the supposed bad service that everyone on Yelp QQs about. My homegirl Cindy always take good care of my entourage. Thank you, Cafe Salina. See you next week! FOREVER.

            Good bubble tea. I&#39;m not sure what side I take in the Ten Ren vs. Fantasia bubble tea feud. They&#39;re both pretty solid in my opinion.I&#39;m docking a star because I got an Oatmeal Raisin cookie and it had chocolate chips in it. Granted, I&#39;m one of those weird people that doesn&#39;t like chocolate and I should&#39;ve asked to be sure, but I was disappointed to pay $2.50 for a cookie that not only had chocolate in it, but was dry and somewhat stale. Will definitely not get anything besides the bubble tea next time.

            Town is SOLID -- like one of your bros that&#39;s there when you need some legit backup.1. Benedict a Trois - If you&#39;re having trouble choosing between the 3 Eggs Benedict options (steak, crab-cake, classic ham), just go with the m√©nage √† trois. My dining partner really enjoyed the crab-cake one, but I found the steak to be the best. ¬†2. Mom&#39;s Meat Loaf Sandwich - My big mouth finally came in handy as I tackled this massive sandwich. This sandwich is a party of wonderful flavors and textures. Those bites where I got fried egg, a bit of crispy onion ring, and some spicy meatloaf coated in gruyere cheese had me hankering for another visit to Town. 3. Chicken and Waffle - I&#39;m not a huge fan of fried chicken, but the juicy chicken served on peppery waffle totally won me over.4. Warm Bread Pudding - While The Refuge down the street still has the best bread pudding, Town put up a solid fight with its piping hot bread pudding served in a lavish Maple-Brandy sauce. Ask for it a la mode to up the ante!And now the sad truth about Town: everything was so damn good, but the menu was filled with tons of other (likely amazing) things. When I return, will I have the COURAGE to order something different? I&#39;m not sure...

            When you walk into an ice cream shop and are greeted with a &#34;Hello! Would you like to try any flavors?&#34; you know you&#39;re going to have a good time. The server here was friendly and didn&#39;t mind handing out sample after sample to eager customers. Picking which ice cream flavors I want is the most important decision I make each week; thanks for helping to make it easier! I ended up going with:1. Secret Breakfast (Bourbon and Corn Flakes) - The Bourbon is strong with this one. Also, because of alcohol&#39;s melting point, this flavor was pleasantly softer than the other flavors. At times, the taste was so strong I felt like I was eating solid Bourbon. My last bite also had one of those large fused chunks of Corn Flakes -- WINNING!2. Pumpkin 5 Spice - A pleasant blend of savory and sweet flavors of my favorite fruit.3. Harvey Milk and Honey Graham - This was my favorite flavor of the three. It tasted like a cup of milk with crushed graham crackers in it -- absolutely awesome. It took me back to my graham-cracker-crushing childhood days.Thank you, Humphry Slocombe. To say you are one of the greatest things to happen to happen to my taste buds may not quite cover how I feel about you.

            I got the Croque Monsieur and was unimpressed at first glance given the meager amount of meat and cheese inside. But it&#39;s not all about quantity sometimes and I learned an important lesson that day: cr√®me fraiche can take an unassuming sandwich and make it absolutely delicious. This sandwich, which was so massive I ate it with a fork and knife, was thoroughly awesome. I&#39;m giving myself 24 hours before I&#39;m craving another one of these bad boys. Then the Pumpkin Galette came out and that took this experience to another level. I love any dish featuring pumpkin and words cannot describe the awesomeness of this savory dessert. The creamy pumpkin pur√©e, the flaky crust wrapping it, and the side of heavenly whipped cream truly moved me in all the right ways.

            My company came to Fang for a company lunch. The dishes we had ranged from mediocre to great. Steamed Shanghai Soup Dumplings - 2/5 - Really thick skin and barely any broth inside these sad dumplings.Pork Steamed Bun - 5/5 - So freaking awesome! The bread was like a cloud: soft, airy, and delicious. Some of the meat inside was chewy, while other pieces were crispy. This was definitely my favorite dish. Fried Shrimp Potstickers - 1/5 - Very sad excuse for potstickers. The skin was super thin and was already falling apart as the dish was brought to our table. The shrimp inside was uninspiring and didn&#39;t do this dish any favors.Fried Shishito Peppers - 2/5 - The peppers were too damn salty!Honey Apple Shrimp - 3/5 - Like Honey Walnut Shrimp sans walnut plus fried apple pieces: fried shrimp and apple lathered in a decadent mayo sauce. This dish could&#39;ve been awesome, but some pieces of shrimp still had the tail (while others didn&#39;t), which was pretty annoying. Also, I&#39;m not quite sure what all the hype is about the owner ordering for you. We went this route and the dishes brought to the table were exactly what I&#39;d expect of a standard visit to a Chinese restaurant. Perhaps the really large party (50+ people) made him play it a bit safer?

            Shrimp Cracker with Spicy Chashu Pork-Mayo Dipping Sauce - A really great appetizer that my party of three shared. The shrimp cracker was crunchy and airy, with a subtle shrimp flavor. The dipping sauce was more like p√¢t√© in consistency and had a little spicy kick. Tonkotsu Ramen - A hearty bowl of ramen featuring a large serving of noodles in a rich broth. It comes with Chasu Pork, but I also asked for Braised Pork Belly to up the awesomeness. I noticed there was barely any smoked egg in the ramen, which was disappointing. House-Made Green Tea Creme Br√ªl√©e - Thick, creamy, and absolutely decadent. The green seared top made the dish look a bit unappetizing. But one bite later I knew I couldn&#39;t judge this creme br√ªl√©e by its burnt cover. Service - Super friendly and attentive service. Our server, Ubi, was talkative and very personable.

            Pot Stickers - 4/5 - These pot stickers were absolutely THICK - packed with meat and cabbage. Unlike other pot stickers, I was able to distinguish the flavors of the meat and ¬†cabbage. These were some of the best pot stickers I&#39;ve had.Fried Crab Meat Cheese Won Tons - 3/5 - Rich and creamy goodness. But then again, it&#39;s pretty tough to go wrong with deep-fried cheese and crab. Fried Chicken Wings - 2/5 - Extremely disappointing. You get six small wings that are the size of frog legs. The flavor of the seasoning and meat also didn&#39;t help this disappointing appetizer.Hong Kong Pan-Fried Noodles - 4/5 - A great entree. The beef was my favorite meat in this eclectic mix, and the bok choy was my favorite veggie. The noodles were also crispy (pan-fried), and if you let them wade in the sauce at the bottom of the plate, you got softer, more flavorful noodles!

            Tutti Frutti is an above average froyo joint. The froyo is creamy, thick, and the flavors are true to their name. I tried Vanilla, Watermelon, Cotton Candy, and Fine-Apple.

            Someone gave my car an unwanted love-tap in a parking lot. Cologne is one of State Farm&#39;s approved body shops, is located right down the block from where I live, and has great Yelp reviews -- so I went with them.Expectations? Absolutely met and exceeded. Dieter and Bill were courteous, professional, and had all the work done on the promised date. I even asked how much it would cost to touch up an unrelated scratch, and they kindly offered to do it for free. Every interaction I had with them was great and I highly recommend them if you ever need to get your vehicle serviced.

            I love jogging around the Bel-Mateo Sports Complex. Here&#39;s a quick rundown!Pros:1. Even though it&#39;s right next to 101, it&#39;s easily accessible via a pedestrian bridge.2. Three times around the soccer field is about a mile so it&#39;s easy to keep track of the distance you&#39;ve covered.3. Easy access to the Bay Trail: a wonderful trail that runs along the Bay. I&#39;ve only made it up to the San Mateo Bridge (4 miles away) so far and it&#39;s gorgeous.4. The complex is frequently in use in the evening so even if you come after sunset, the stadium lighting will keep everything nice and bright. ¬†Cons:1. Geese hang out here, and they just looove to poop everywhere. Watch your step!

            My friend and I dropped by Ariake after we got a good beating at kendo practice. Excitement overtook my weary body as my eyes spied cooked and fried sushi rolls: my favorites. Could they be as good as the ones at my favorite sushi place: Cha Cha in San Jose?The rolls we got were a mixed bag. I really enjoyed their Lion King Roll (crab, avocado, wrapped in salmon and baked with special sauce). The roll had a little tangy kick towards the end of each bite that I couldn&#39;t really put my finger on, so I figured the special sauce was just doing its thing. On the other hand, the Godzilla Roll (fried yellowtail topped with sweet and spicy sauce) was totally disappointing. Some pieces of this roll had barely any fish in them. Dessert was again a mixed bag. The Green Tea Cheese Cake should actually be called Green Tea Ice Cream Shaped Like a Cake. It looked like what I&#39;d imagine green tea cheese cake looks like, but it was FROZEN. I want my cheesecake to be soft and creamy, not hard. The Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Service was friendly, yet we had to repeatedly ask for refills. We had just spent 2 hours in heavy armor beating each other with wooden swords so we were pretty parched. Even after we kindly asked, explaining to the waitress that we were pretty thirsty, it still took a while to get our refills.

            I felt like the luckiest princess in the world dining at Tea Era. Tea Era.. Tiara.. Get it?! ...Anyway, I liked this place. The tea wasn&#39;t too sweet. The bubbles were chewy and smaller than what I&#39;m used to. And while I forgot to ask for less ice, Tea Era doesn&#39;t stuff your cup with ice by default. My knight in shining armor (my bro) enjoyed a Green Bean Smoothie which -- true to its name -- tasted very strongly of green bean.

            Dim Sum King is my dream come true: all my favorite dim sum dishes, all prepared well, and available all day, every day! I dropped by with two friends and we ordered a massive feast that came out to only $40. My go-to dim sum item, the Steamed BBQ Pork Bun, was impressive. The bread was soft. Inside were large, juicy chunks of pork. The fried Crispy Shrimp Pocket, featuring two (not one!) pieces of shrimp, was awesome. The Taro Puffs were packed with pork. Their Potstickers were made with chicken, which is outside of the norm, but I liked them. The Spinach and Shrimp Dumplings also had an interesting smoky flavor; I&#39;m not sure if this was on purpose or by mistake, but, hey, I liked it.You can order most items in a set of 3 or even just a single item, so you don&#39;t have to come with friends to maximize the number of menu items you can sample. But good food is always better with good friends, so grab them and head on over to Dim Sum King!

            When getting my frozen yogurt at Yoogl, two things immediately left a sour taste in my mouth: they had two yogurt stations completely empty (fewer flavors to choose from) and the yogurt had a runny, watery consistency. That said, it was still tasty. My favorite flavor was the Oatmeal Cookie; it tasted like someone froze an oatmeal cookie and then pureed it. I hope the empty stations were a one off event because it tainted an otherwise pleasant froyo stop at Yoogl.

            A truly magical Eiji experience is composed of two periods: before dessert and after dessert. Make sure you enjoy both, so pre-order dessert when you arrive, as they do run of out of desserts. Before dessert, you can feast on many delicious things. The Oboro Tofu features a large bowl of hot tofu in a light broth, with a set of accompanying toppings. While I enjoyed the spicy radish and minced ginger, I ended up eating most of the soft, creamy tofu without any toppings. The Eggplant with Walnut Miso was out of this world. The Walnut Miso was hot, creamy, and had walnut slivers layered throughout. Eiji offers mostly traditional rolls, but their Ceviche Roll (hamachi with homemade salsa) is non-traditional and tastes like a sushi taco!You pre-ordered dessert, so now things are going to the next level. The Strawberry Mochi has an actual strawberry inside it, wrapped in a layer of red bean paste and soft sticky rice cake. The Purple Sweet Potato Yokan features a subdued sweet purple yam cake topped with some rich vanilla ice cream on top. Every bite was wonderful; the cake was firm, yet melted in your mouth along with the ice cream.You really can&#39;t go wrong at Eiji. Everything we tried was fresh, prepared well, and thoroughly enjoyable. To boot, unlike other great sushi restaurants that sometimes have snobby service, Eiji has a friendly staff that is always helpful if you need some recommendations or don&#39;t know what a particular item is.

            My coworker is a self-confessed bubble tea snob and this Ten Ren Tea is her favorite bubble tea place in the Bay Area. My bubble tea acuity isn&#39;t particularly high, but this place makes great bubble tea. I always go with the #4: black milk tea with bubbles. The tea hits the right level of sweetness every time, and the tapioca is chewy. The staff here is always friendly, even when they get busy. Every time I&#39;m down in Cupertino, I drop by Ten Ren, and it&#39;s always worth it.

            The food here is great, and the staff is friendly. The Cupertino location is pretty much the same as the San Mateo one except:1. It&#39;s a lot smaller, but just as popular, so expect to wait a good amount of time if you don&#39;t arrive when they open. 2. The people at the front are terrible at giving you an estimate of how long you&#39;ll wait; our 30 minute wait time ended up being over an hour.3. Tall booths and mood lighting provide a little more privacy and a more chill atmosphere, which is different from the more open and bright San Mateo location.4. Parking in downtown San Mateo isn&#39;t a cakewalk, but this location has a very small parking lot and there are a few other Chinese restaurants in the complex, so be prepared to look for parking elsewhere.

            I was referred to Chiro-Medical Group for physical therapy to alleviate tendonitis in my arm. I worked with Tim King, who was a fantastic physical therapist. During the first, hour-long appointment Tim did a bunch of manual muscle testing to figure out exactly what was triggering the pain in my arm. During the next four half-hour appointments Tim massaged my arm, continued to do manual muscle tests to gauge progress, and taught me some exercises to prevent future injury. Pain dissipated and with Tim&#39;s recommended exercises, I&#39;m hoping to avoid dealing with this issue again. The only bad thing I have to say about Chiro is their billing department. After my second appointment, I met with their Patient Rights Advocate a.k.a. Bill Collector in disguise. He couldn&#39;t tell me how much I owed Chiro, but he insisted I put a payment down right there and then. When I asked him how much each appointment was going to cost me, he couldn&#39;t give me a straight answer, even though he had already spoken to my insurance company. I can understand that they might&#39;ve gotten duped in the past by patients who couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t pay their bill, but that&#39;s no reason to treat everyone like a miscreant who is trying to nickel and dime you.In short, Tim was absolutely awesome, but their Patient Rights Advocate could stand to learn a thing or two about treating patients like people instead of thieves.

            Average is the best word that describes Joy Restaurant. My party sampled several dishes. While most things were okay, nothing impressed us. Each bite just got us thinking about another restaurant that prepared that item better.I tried my two goto Chinese dishes: Xiao Long Bao and Chives Pancake. The Xiao Long Bao ended up being our least favorite dish. The skin was too thick, most dumplings had no broth in them, and the meat tasted odd. The Chives Pancake was okay, but was certainly not the best I&#39;ve had.There are plenty of restaurants in the area that do Chinese cuisine really well, and unfortunately Joy restaurant just couldn&#39;t stand out.

            Unassumingly sitting on El Camino near the Hillsdale Caltrain Station is Jack&#39;s Prime: a classy shake and burger joint. My Jack&#39;s Prime Classic Cheeseburger with Saut√©ed Mushrooms and Onions was flavorful. The patty itself was supposedly a third of a pound, but it looked a lot smaller than that. I also requested the burger be cooked medium, but was disappointed to find it was well-done.The fries really shine. My dining partner and I shared an order of Irish Nacho Fries (melted cheddar, crispy bacon bits, green onions, tabasco mayo). It was difficult to get all the ingredients in one bite, but when you did, it was a faaabulous party in your mouth. The Garlic Fries are truly garlicky: loaded with pungent garlic. The Sweet Potato Fries were also good; the mayo served with these fries was awesome.Our meal up to this point was great, but then we ordered dessert. The New York Cheesecake was absolutely disappointing. There was no difference in texture between the crust and the cake filling. The filling itself wasn&#39;t even soft; it was kind of chewy. It tasted like something you&#39;d buy in the frozen foods section of a grocery store. There were a few hiccups along the way, but overall our visit to Jack&#39;s Prime was good. The food was good, came out fast, and the service was extremely friendly. Next time I visit, I&#39;ll skip dessert and walk down to Yumi Yogurt to satisfy my sweet tooth.

The potatoes were flavorful, the beans were good and hearty, and the eggs on thick corn tortillas smothered in cheese and salsa were to die for. My dining partner enjoyed his Eggs Benedict with Avocado and Bacon, although it would&#39;ve been nice for them to provide more Hollandaise sauce so the potatoes could get some loving too. All in all, Whispers Cafe got our day off to a great start and we are eager to grab breakfast here again.

            Some say this restaurant is in Millbrae, while others say San Bruno. All I know is, Yi Yuan dishes out some seriously good Chinese food. Offering many spicy Szechuan dishes, I found the menu&#39;s claim that the food will be &#34;spicy but not numbing&#34; to be spot on. My dining partner and I shared two noodle bowls. The Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles reminded me of an Italian spaghetti dish as it featured a heaping serving of spaghetti topped with ground meat. The noodles were thick and hearty, and once the spicy sauce sitting at the bottom of this dish was mixed in, the dish packed quite a punch. The Lanzhou Beef Ramen was good, but a bit too spicy for me. Featuring thin-cut slices of beef with noodles in a spicy-looking broth, I enjoyed a few bites before tears of joy and spiciness overwhelmed me.We also ordered some dim sum style dishes. The Green Onion and Beef Roll featured layers of dough, beef, and green onion, and was like a mixture between a fried and fresh roll. The Beef Pancakes were packed with beef and a ridiculous amount of broth: so much so that I got a fair amount on my shirt! The Leek Pancakes featured a soft dough shell, and were filled with tasty chives. While the noodle dishes were a bit spicy, these dim sum style items were not spicy at all.I was pleased with everything we ordered. The staff here is incredibly friendly, which was a pleasant surprise given the usual service one gets at Chinese restaurants. The decor, aiming to mimic joints in the rural Chinese countryside, was also awesome. The menu is large, and there are plenty of non-spicy items; so don&#39;t let the Szechuan label scare you away from a great experience.

            I&#39;m always hesitant to visit Italian restaurants. If a place can put spaghetti and tomato sauce together, they seem to consider themselves qualified to serve Italian. When I walked into Delizie, I was expecting mediocre pasta with mediocre sauce. But halfway through our meal when our server asked us, &#34;Tutto bene?&#34; I almost told him, &#34;It&#39;s not okay... It&#39;s amazing!&#34;I had Pappardelle Al Cinghiale (egg pasta, wild boar tomato meat sauce, celery, carrots, red onions). I&#39;m not a huge fan of pasta, but the egg pasta in this dish was so fresh and amazing, I couldn&#39;t help but devour it all. The meat sauce was flavorful, and the small chunks of boar meat sprinkled throughout made this dish a real winner.My sister got the gluten-free Penne Piccantine (Pomodoro sauce, chili peppers, garlic, fresh ricotta cheese and champignon mushroom). It wasn&#39;t a big mush of pasta like you normally get with gluten-free pasta, so if you hadn&#39;t told me it was gluten-free, I wouldn&#39;t have figured it out. The sauce in this dish was out of this world: thick, creamy, cheesy, with a little spicy kick. When my sister was done eating, I grabbed some bread and wiped every last drop of sauce off the plate! The restaurant boasts a great ambiance, and the staff is extremely personable and friendly. Aside from their gluten-free pasta, which is imported from Italy, all their pasta is homemade and it shows. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try any appetizers or desserts, but I&#39;ll definitely be coming back to Delizie. The place does Italian food true justice -- vera giustizia.

If you get a burrito -- or Burroti as they call it -- you&#39;ll get to watch them take a ball of dough and instantly turn it into a wrap with a magical, super-powered roti baking machine!I tried to go a bit healthier, so I went with Whole Wheat Roti and Brown Rice for my Burroti. I couldn&#39;t decide between Chicken or Paneer (Farmer&#39;s Cheese), so I asked for both and the server happily obliged. The Burroti was flavorful, and every bite that had some paneer in it was absolutely delightful. Flavor might&#39;ve not always been there, but with an extra side of Tikka Sauce at my side, that problem became no problem at all. The Burroti is a bit smaller than a Chipotle Burrito, but that isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.Tava is gluten-free friendly, but you won&#39;t be able to get their Burroti since they do not offer gluten-free wraps. I enjoyed my visit and will definitely visit Tava when I get a hankering for Indian Chipotle.

            If you&#39;re vegan or gluten-free, Plant Caf√© Organic serves up okay dessert items. The items won&#39;t blow your mind and some are downright disappointing. Then again, you probably won&#39;t find many places attempting to make a cake that is both gluten-free and vegan.Surprisingly, the gluten-free and vegan Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was my dining partner&#39;s favorite dish. The cake was moist, flavorful, and the serving was absolutely massive. On the other hand, the Spicy Chewy Chocolate Cookie (gluten-free) tasted like it had almost no chocolate in it. My Peanut Butter Cookie (vegan) lacked a strong peanut flavor. The Strawberry Smoothie (strawberries, dates, vanilla, soymilk) was uninspiring at best.I would normally give a place like Plant Caf√© two stars, but I applaud their effort to cater to people on restricted diets. At the end of the day, they didn&#39;t execute well on the majority of the items we sampled. Given we had some extraordinary vegan and gluten-free desserts at Zadin in the Mission earlier in the week, the bar might&#39;ve been too high from the get-go.

            Vik&#39;s is my favorite Indian restaurant in a grocery store, with the quirkiest ordering system. You order food at a register, then wait for your name to be called as the dishes come out from the kitchen, and you then go retrieve your food. If you order a few different items, you&#39;ll have everything only after a few trips to the serving area. My dining party ordered a bunch of items off the menu and we shared them family-style. I love bread so I wasn&#39;t surprised to find the big puffy thing -- Cholle Bhature -- was one of my favorite items. The fried bread by itself was awesome, but adding some spicy chickpeas upped the ante. I also enjoyed the Lamb Baida Roti, which is what I imagined an Indian quesadilla with lamb would taste like. I wasn&#39;t a fan of some other dishes we ordered. This was not because they were prepared poorly: our Indian dining partner assured me every dish met his expectations. I just personally wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavors and textures. The Dahi Pakori featured lentil dumplings that seemed a bit too dry, and the yogurt they were served in was a bit too tart for my tastes. I found a similar tartness in the yogurt-lathered Dahi Batata Puri.While every dish didn&#39;t appeal to my tastes, Vik&#39;s seems to be the place to go for Indian food in Berkeley. During my visit, I ran into two coworkers -- one dropping his daughter off at school and another driving down from Tahoe. It&#39;s not a coincidence -- it&#39;s just people choosing to eat at good restaurants!

            With lines far out the door, CREAM must have something going for it. I was hoping it would be delicious ice cream, but it seems CREAM is just a great value proposition: you&#39;re going to get a lot of okay ice cream for a great price.I had scoops of French Vanilla, Strawberry Cheesecake, and Matcha Green Tea in a cup. The Strawberry Cheesecake -- which is made with gluten-free cheesecake -- was the best of the three, but didn&#39;t really blow me away.Their ice cream sandwiches seemed popular, so I&#39;ll have to give CREAM another shot when I run into one. Perhaps the cookies will complement the ice cream to create a product that is greater than the sum of its parts!

            Quince Cafe and Grill serves up some great brunch-oriented dishes. Delicious food (including plenty of gluten-free options) and friendly service make Quince Cafe a real winner.My dining partner and I shared three dishes: Eggs Benedict, Chicken Hash, and Fresh Blueberry Buckwheat Pancakes. The Eggs Benedict, covered in a delicious house-made hollandaise sauce, were delicious. The accompanying eastern spiced Hash Browns were crispy, but didn&#39;t pack the flavor I was expecting. The Chicken Hash was a medley of crispy chicken, potatoes, onion, and garlic, topped with two sunny side up eggs. While the dish as a whole was great, the chicken was a bit dry. The Blueberry Pancakes were moist and packed with whole blueberries. There were so many other dishes at Quince that we wanted to try. While two of our three dishes weren&#39;t absolutely perfect, we enjoyed them all. Next time I&#39;m in Berkeley, I&#39;ll definitely be coming to Quince again.

            A visit to Kara&#39;s Cupcakes is akin to visiting a casino. You&#39;re going to put down a bit of money, and either win big or lose big. Some cupcakes at Kara&#39;s are absolutely amazing, while others make me deeply regret my cupcake choices.My dining party sampled a selection of cupcakes. The Chocolate Velvet was popular; incredibly chocolately, really moist, and had incredibly soft frosting. On the other hand, the Sweet Vanilla was bland and had frosting that was too hard and thick. The Banana Caramel was okay, and the Fleur de Sel was underwhelming. I love and hate Kara&#39;s Cupcakes. Go with a group so you can share cupcakes, and figure out what you like and don&#39;t like. If you find you love everything, congratulations -- you&#39;ve won big!

            LYFE (Love Your Food Everyday) Kitchen is like a fast-food restaurant focused on healthy food: you&#39;re going to get something tasty that could be considered healthy food. The dishes are marketed as healthy, but contain far too much sodium. The low calorie count on every dish seems awesome, until you realize the portions are tiny. Given this, the price of dishes at LYFE makes me feel like a sucker.My dining party shared a BBQ Chicken Flatbread, a Classic Burger, and an order of Art&#39;s Unfried Chicken. These dishes were good, but really didn&#39;t satisfy our hunger. While I can understand why they added a ton of lime to the Kale and Banana Smoothie (to offset the bitterness of the kale), doing the same for the Strawberry Yogurt Smoothie just didn&#39;t work. I was expecting a sweet smoothie, but instead got a sour one. LYFE is worth checking out if you don&#39;t mind paying a lot for a little. But if you truly want to eat healthy, this place is not it.

            People sensitive to gluten, have no fear! Zadin provides a wonderful menu packed with gluten-free options that&#39;ll have you eating things you never thought you would ever eat again!My dining party shared an order of the Salt and Pepper Calamari and Imperial Rolls -- both gluten-free. Gluten-free items often get a bad reputation for being drier than their gluten-infused counterparts, but both of these items were juicy and delicious. Our gluten-sensitive dining partner was able to eat great calamari; something she hadn&#39;t done in years!For the main course, two of us had the Pho Bo (Beef Noodle Soup), which was a large bowl filled with flavorful broth, hearty rice noodles, lean cuts of meat, and beef meatballs. Our other dining partner enjoyed a bowl of Tiger Prawns with Garlic Noodles. The noodles -- tossed in soy garlic sauce, egg, butter -- were pleasantly dense and packed with flavor.For dessert, we ordered the Brownie with Mitchell&#39;s Coconut Ice Cream -- the gluten-free and regular version. Both were delicious and moist; my dining partner tried both and could barely tell the difference between the two. I got the Coconut Lime Cake, which was BOTH gluten-free and vegan. I&#39;m not sure how you make cake delicious under these circumstances, but Zadin somehow made the cake enjoyable and moist. From start to finish, Zadin was extremely impressive. The menu is a long list of delicious dishes, most of which are gluten-free. The staff is friendly and knowledgable about gluten sensitivities. If you know anyone who is on a gluten-free diet or just craving awesome Vietnamese food, bring them here -- you won&#39;t regret it!

            I visited Mariposa at the Ferry Building with my sister who is sensitive to gluten. Faced with a vast amount of cookies, bread, muffins, sandwiches, quiches, we had an incredibly hard time deciding what to get.I had an amazing Cheese Danish. Even though it was gluten-free, the danish was moist, not overly chewy, and a pleasure to eat. My sister enjoyed her Chocolate Chip Cookie and Chocolate Pumpkin Muffin, citing them as some of the absolute best gluten-free pastries she&#39;s ever had.There was so much that caught both our eyes. I know where I&#39;ll stop by for some food gifts before I make any trips home!

            Blue Line Pizza dishes out stellar pizza, but beware as the desserts will quickly ruin what could have been a pleasant dining experience.The Pesto Chicken Pizza (pesto, roasted chicken, mushrooms, roasted red peppers, onions) was piled high with fresh, flavorful ingredients and tender chicken. Our custom made pizza (bacon, mozzarella, mushrooms, tomato sauce) was good, but not nearly as impressive as the suggested pies on the menu. A member of our party had a gluten sensitivity so we went with gluten-free thin crusts for both our pies. The gluten-free crust was great: thin, moist, and didn&#39;t fall apart -- as most gluten-free products normally do. Blue Line Pizza had earned a solid 4 stars, but then we ordered the two dessert items they offer: Caramel Apple Breading Pudding and a Open-Faced Gelato Sandwich. Even though our server told us both were great, both were incredibly underwhelming and disappointing, especially compared to the pizza. The bread pudding was totally uniform; it was not crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, like I&#39;ve come to expect of good bread pudding. It was also too chewy and had an undesired rubbery texture to it. The Gelato Sandwich featured an uninspiring (perhaps even flat-out bland) cookie on a bed of mediocre ice cream. At least, microwave the cookie!I wish we could forget about dessert so I could give this place a higher rating because the pizza was really top notch. That said, I highly recommend Blue Line Pizza, but only if you skip over dessert.

            Come to the Counter to create -- from an impressive list of options -- your own gourmet burger. Order a side of some amazing Sweet Potato Fries, with even more amazing Chipotle Aioli Mayonnaise sauce, and prepare yourself for a unique experience. Even with a plethora of combinations for a burger, I always go with a Turkey Burger with Swiss, Saut√©ed Mushrooms, Grilled Onions, on a Ciabatta Roll with Sweet BBQ Sauce. The ciabatta roll is soft, the onions and mushroom are large and plentiful, and the Swiss cheese adds a light, cheesy flavor and creamy texture. Spread the Sweet BBQ Sauce on the bun, and you&#39;ve got my favorite right there. The Turkey patty is a bit drier than a Beef patty, but I try to be a bit healthier when I come here. You can go wrong at The Counter because with great power to build your own burger comes power to build a complete disaster. Keep it simple and don&#39;t add everything you like. Not only will it be massive and impossible to keep together, it probably won&#39;t taste good.The Counter is also gluten-free friendly. Ask and they&#39;ll provide a menu with all the burger ingredients that are gluten-free -- although most of the ingredients are gluten-free so you won&#39;t be missing out. Our server even told us the gluten-free stuff is prepared separately in the kitchen, which is the way to go to avoid gluten cross-contamination. This place is popular and gets really busy. Consequently, service can be slow at times as there never seems to be enough servers to comfortably handle the crowd this place draws. That said, even with slow service, the servers are always friendly and helpful, and the food is worth it.

            Curry Up Now offers good Indian food with a Mexican twist, lightning fast service, great prices, and plenty of gluten-free options. My dining party shared an order of Cross Cut Sweet Potato Fries with Maggi Ketchup. The fries were good, but dipping too far into the ketchup added too much spice, which overpowered the taste of the fries. My flavorful Chicken Tikka Masala Burrito hit the spot. It was packed with rice, chickpeas, onions, and chicken in a spicy tomato and cream sauce. It&#39;s not massive like a Chipotle burrito, but at least you won&#39;t feel like a terrible glutton after eating the whole thing. My dining partner got the gluten-free version of the same burrito: the burrito&#39;s contents were served on a plate, with an accompanying gluten-free tortilla. For dessert, I got the Fried Cheese Cake Bites. These are concisely described as dangerously decadent. Each of the six bites was a small piece of cheesecake with a graham cracker crust. Already delicious, deep frying these pieces of cake took amazing to the next level!Curry Up Now isn&#39;t my favorite Indian restaurant -- my favorite is Amber India in Mountain View -- but it certainly is my favorite Indian restaurant &#34;with a cool twist.&#34;e

            Nestled on a pier in the back of the Edgewater Shopping Complex is Cooking Papa: a restaurant that offers great waterfront views, a diverse menu of good food, and spunky, borderline rude service. The Deep Fried Pumpkin and Eggplant with Spicy Salt featured large cubes of fried eggplant and pumpkin. While the pieces of eggplant were soft, the large pieces of pumpkin were much harder. I was hoping for softer pumpkin pieces like those served at Champagne Restaurant in Millbrae. Being Portuguese, the Portuguese Baked Seafood Rice piqued my interest. With that familiar yellow coloring, a variety of seafood, and a serving size my grandmother would be proud of, this dish was one of my favorites. The yellow curry on top was quite a lot thicker than the more runny traditional Portuguese dish I&#39;m used to, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The Watercress and Tender Pork Ribs Soup was packed with pieces of pork that infused the broth with flavor. The Steamed Pork Dumplings with Soup, with thin skin and filled with a rich broth, were better than most others I&#39;ve had. We enjoyed the juicy Roasted Peking Duck; I enjoyed the accompanying steamed buns that helped me wipe the curry sauce off my plate. The large, light, and fluffy Hong Kong Style Egg Puffs pleasantly ended our meal.

            I came into Tutti Frutti to grab some frozen yogurt, but ended up also leaving with some bubble tea and a half-dozen of Roti Buns. The Milk Bubble Tea wasn&#39;t too impressive. The tapioca was too chewy, and the tea tasted like flavored water. I did enjoy the whipped cream they topped the tea off with. I sampled two flavors of their frozen yogurt: Mango and Vanilla. The Mango was flavorful, light, and true to its name. I&#39;m not sure what the Vanilla tasted like. It definitely wasn&#39;t vanilla, but it was enjoyable regardless. ¬†Tutti Frutti was on course for mediocrity, but then I dug into the box of their Roti Buns. When I came in they had two types of Roti Buns, butter and cream cheese, with two types of &#34;frosting&#34; on top: vanilla and coffee. Unlike the insubstantial buns at Honey Berry, the buns here are packed top to bottom with light, juicy bread filling. The distribution of cream cheese in the buns was uneven, but I still thoroughly enjoyed it, even the parts without cream cheese.

            Some friends and I dropped by Kahoo Ramen for a late lunch. I had the Kotteri Miso Ramen: rich, garlicky miso broth with cha-shu pork, menma, egg, bean sprouts, spinach, and onion. The broth was rich, but I couldn&#39;t pick out the taste of garlic because the rest was so salty. The noodles were a bit too firm. The dish featured a meager amount of pork. It would&#39;ve been nice to get more, even if I had to pay more, but that wasn&#39;t an option. Overall, the dish was okay, but there was a lot of room for improvement. The service here isn&#39;t bad, but it&#39;s nothing to brag about either. The salty ramen made me thirsty, but no one ever came around to refill our glasses of water. We actually only saw our server twice: when she took our order and when she brought the bill over.I&#39;m no ramen buff, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can do better.

            I grabbed a box of 10 pieces of mochi from Shuei-Do Manju for my friend. I don&#39;t know much about mochi, but I know Peanut Butter Mochi can&#39;t be bad so I got one of those to reward myself for being such an awesome friend. I enjoyed it thoroughly. It was chewy, elastic, sticky, and had a dollop of the peanut butter flavor I love.My friend was a tougher critic. She thought the red bean paste was too sweet, and also lacked the distinct red bean fragrance. The mini red bean buns had tough breading, and didn&#39;t taste fresh. Funnily enough, like me, she enjoyed the Peanut Butter Mochi most!

            Peter&#39;s Cafe is a diner at heart. Huge overhead sign outside, plenty of booth-seating, friendly service, fast turn-around on orders, huge portions of decent comfort food, and a menu that made me feel like I was back home in NJ.My dining partner was a bit intimidated by the size of his order of Corn Beef Hash and Eggs with Hash Browns, yet ended up scarfing it down. I ordered one of the daily specials: a Bacon, Egg, and Cheese Croissant Sandwich. Expecting a modest sandwich, I was awestruck to find that it was raised on the Texan Croissant Farm -- where croissants are large and in charge. The sandwich packed a lot of egg, a little bit of cheese, and as always, never enough bacon. Even with a lacking amount of cheese and bacon, the sandwich was pleasant and pretty cheap; next time I&#39;ll offer to pay extra to get more cheese and bacon.The food didn&#39;t blow me away, but I enjoyed my visit to Peter&#39;s Cafe. The menu is large and diverse, so I know where I&#39;m coming next time I need to satisfy a NJ diner nostalgia trip. The Oven Baked Puff Pancake sounded great, especially the German Baby flavor. I&#39;ve never tasted German babies! Unfortunately, we were in a rush and the dish takes 30 minutes to prepare. I&#39;ll call ahead next time!

            There is sure to be something in Sweet Indulgence&#39;s 20-page menu to satisfy every facet of your sweet tooth. The service here is friendly, the atmosphere is homey, and the food is decent.My dining partner and I shared a bunch of different items. The Milk Bubble Tea was good: it wasn&#39;t overly sweet, had chewy tapioca, and the tea had a pleasant, thick consistency. My dining partner was disappointed to find the Honey Jelly with Watermelon Juice was mostly slush and not much juice; it should have been listed under Slushies but was not. I found the Mango Pudding with Mango Delight refreshing and mangotastic, but my friend thought the mango was pretty sour. The Egg Puffs were plentiful, light, fluffy; my friend ¬†was even overcome with a swell of nostalgia for Taiwan eating these puffs. The Toasted Bun with Butter and Condensed Milk was crunchy and sweet, and the hot Steamed Milk Pudding was great. We didn&#39;t eat anything mind-blowing, yet we appreciated the diverse offerings at Sweet Indulgence. Perhaps there are hidden gems on the menu we missed; if we were to search them out ourselves, it would take a pretty long time!

            I came in for a sports massage with Ania: a kind, professional, and knowledgeable masseuse. The massage itself was great. Ania warned me before starting that she was going to dig in deep. If I ever felt like the pressure was too great (for example, if I found myself holding my breath), she told me to give her a heads up. That said, she definitely dug deep, yet the entire time never applied an uncomfortable amount of pressure. Two days after the massage, the soreness subsided and I felt totally refreshed. I have no complaints about Ania and her work, but do think the office environment could improve on a few things that blemished an otherwise great experience. During my massage there was music playing from a therapeutic radio station on Sirius XM. I knew this because every so often, an announcer interrupted the music (and my calmed mind) to announce the station we were listening to. Massage Fitness must have Comcast internet because towards the middle of my massage, the music started stuttering. There was also a ticking clock in the room; I would have preferred it not be there.

            El Sur serves up excellent empanadas. Inside the crispy, golden crust are fresh ingredients that go together quite well. When I stopped by their rustic food truck, I grabbed -- fresh out of the oven -- a Pollo Saltado (chicken, onions, tomatoes, serranos, olive, egg) and a Champi√±ones (sliced mushroom, shallots, cr√®me fra√Æche, provolone, chives). I love mushrooms, cheese, chives, and creamy textures, so it didn&#39;t surprise me when the Champi√±ones was my favorite of the two. I half-expected the sour cr√®me fra√Æche to be the most distinct flavor in each bite, but was pleasantly surprised to find the taste of mushrooms come through clearly.You might feel like you&#39;re getting gypped paying ~$4 for their small empanadas. Savor each bite and your taste buds will prove they are worth their cost. They were out of their other empanadas as well as their churros when we stopped by; I&#39;m looking forward to catching El Sur when they&#39;re in town again to try out their other items.

            Hiyaaa! serves up delicious Asian-fusion grub out of a food truck. You pick a protein (lemongrass chicken, bulkogi, spicy pork, lemongrass mushrooms) and then pick a bed for it (rice, roll, fries, salad).During our visit, we tried Bulkogi on a Stuffed Roll. Paying the extra $2 for double meat was definitely worth it because the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The Korean Seasoning on the sandwich was great, although I felt it overpowered the meat&#39;s flavor. My last bite was just the roll with some meat, and it was absolutely great because I was able to really taste just how awesome the beef was.The Salt and Pepper Fried Chicken Bites were crispy and seasoned well, but could have been slightly better with some sauce. I&#39;m not sure if they had sauce hidden in their truck, but we didn&#39;t bother to go ask because the chicken bites were addictive even in our sauceless situation.They take credit cards with a Square reader, but they did one thing -- that no other Off the Grid vendors did -- that irked me. Every other truck there took your card, swiped it, selected 0% for the tip, and then returned your card. When the lady at Hiyaaa! taking my order handed me her iPad displaying options for tips, I was confused. Why ask me to pay 20% gratuity for a takeout order -- at a food truck? While waiting for our food, I saw people split between 0% and the topmost option: 15%. Customers&#39; impulse decisions might earn them a bit more money, but it just seemed really shady that they were the only ones at Off the Grid doing this.

            We Sushi is as close to my favorite sushi restaurant -- Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose -- as I&#39;ve found, and it&#39;s a freaking food truck! I&#39;ll admit I was a bit skeptical as I walked up to a truck to order sushi rolls, but after the first bite, my concerns were put to rest. ¬†The Wheel of Fire (Spicy California Roll topped with tuna, jalape√±o slices, chef&#39;s special sauce) was a good roll that provided a manageable spicy twist on the tried and true California Roll. But it was the Lobster Crunch (Lobster salad in a light wasabi dressing, cucumber, avocado in soy wrap) that made my mouth water for more. The lobster salad was spot on: hot, flavorful, with a spicy tease. The fried soy wrap gave the entire dish a crunchy texture, which complemented the gooey lobster salad.I was seriously considering getting back in line to order some more food after enjoying these two rolls, but opted to sample some of the other food trucks during our visit to Off the Grid. Next time We Sushi rolls into town, you can be sure I&#39;m going to sample their other offerings.

            My cupcake-eating party shared four cupcakes: Red Velvet, Strawberry Cream, Key Lime Pie, and Kara&#39;s Karrot. The cupcakes come with a good amount of frosting, but it never felt like an overwhelming amount. The frosting is airy, too: soft, light, and just melts in your mouth.Of the four we sampled, the Strawberry Cream was our favorite. Inside the soft, juicy cake was some delicious strawberry cream filling. The blend of the simple cake, frosting, and cream filling made this cupcake a real winner. On the other hand, the Red Velvet was disappointingly dry. That said, for cupcakes coming out of a van, we were highly impressed with Kara&#39;s Cupcakes.

            Finally! The Belmont Caltrain parking lot is unnecessarily huge, but Off the Grid&#39;s food truck posse is doing its best to put the massive lot to work.During our visit, we had eight trucks to choose from, serving up Mediterranean, empanadas, sushi, Asian fusion, Peruvian, gua bao, and even cupcakes. My friend and I visited half of the food trucks and were very happy with each stop during our nontraditional dining experience. There was even a talented musician, Steven Norman Long, who put on an amazing show featuring covers and original content.Even though Belmont is a small town, Off the Grid draws quite a crowd so expect a wait, especially at popular trucks like the Chairman Truck. Come early too, because the food trucks run out of items.

            El Metate offers huge portions... of lackluster food.My dining partner and I shared an order of Super Nachos. The nachos were good, but came with a meager amount of meat. Our Super Burritos were absolutely massive, but the flavor profile was uninspiring. An inspection of a cross section of the burrito reveals that it was packed with a good amount of meat, rice, beans, cheese, guacamole, and sour cream. But even with all of these flavor-filled ingredients, each bite was bland and boring. When I picked out just some carnitas meat, I found the meat to be disappointingly dry and overly chewy.For the price, I was expecting large, flavorful portions. El Metate rocked one of my expectations, but fell short on the other.

            New Hwong Kok offers a good variety of dim sum items to different levels of success. The items I enjoyed included the chive-packed, thick-skinned Chive Dumplings, as well as the Shrimp Dumplings. The Steamed BBQ Pork Buns featured soft, moist bread packed with a decent amount of pork filling. The Coconut Buns were soft with plenty of sweet coconut filling. The Taro Puff weren&#39;t the best I&#39;ve had, but they were good.The Sausage Bun was a bit disappointing. The short sausage only filled half the bun. The Baked BBQ Pork Bun was coated in a strangely sticky glaze, and all the pork was packed into one half of the bun. The Fried Meat Dumplings were also a bit too greasy for me.This restaurant definitely offered a mix of hits and misses. We came in near closing time, so they were out of some items I was interested in trying like the Chives Pancake. The restaurant is kind of grungy-looking, but the area the food was displayed in was clean.

Parking on a Friday night in the area was a huge pain, so we ended up just parking in the Passenger Loading zone directly outside, and quickly ran inside.My Bubble Milk Tea was good: not too sweet with plenty of chewy tapioca. My friend enjoyed her Green Tea. We also tried their Red Velvet Candy Pops. Each consisted of a ball of red velvet cake coated with white chocolate that both of us thoroughly enjoyed.

            My dining partner and I wanted to go somewhere special for my 100th review. We were expecting Passionfish to be good, but everything we ordered turned out to be absolutely amazing. The service was top notch, the ambiance was refined without any snobbery, and the food was beyond words.We shared three appetizers. The Dungeness Crab Cake was very juicy and came with a good amount of lime and pepper relish. However, it turned out to be the weakest dish. The Seafood Caldo was a spicy tomato-cilantro broth featuring different soft pieces of fish that just melted in your mouth. The Burrata provided a great mixture of sweet (roasted heirloom tomatoes), savory (arugula) flavors, and soft (burrata), crunchy (toast) textures.Our entr√©es were top notch. My dining partner loved the Sea Scallops dish, featuring three huge, fresh, tender scallops, a tomato-truffle butter sauce, and a mound of delicious savory rice custard. Tasting all three in one bite was astounding. I ordered Sp√§tzle, a hearty dish that came with small, thick flour-based noodles, delicious pieces of braised wagyu sugo, burnt chard, and aged asiago to give the entire dish a smooth, creamy texture. Again, delicious!Dessert topped off our amazing experience. My dining partner enjoyed a Straus Organic Mint and Espresso Mud Pie with Chocolate Sauce, featuring ice cream with pieces of espresso beans and a crunchy and chewy chocolate cookie base. Our waitress hyped up the Strawberry Peach Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream, so I ordered that. Even with the hype, the cobbler absolutely blew my mind! It was just a perfect blend of flavors and textures. The cobbler was warm, soft, chewy and moist. The ice cream was cool and flavorful. The peaches and strawberries were warm and sweet. In short, the dish was perfection.

            Lopez Restaurante Y Cantina easily and happily accommodated a large group when we stopped by on a Saturday evening. But the food wasn&#39;t anything special. My dining partner got the Pork Tamales de Mama Chela. Even though the menu says the tamales were soaked in mole sauce, the dough ended up being a bit dry. I had the Manchamantel: small chunks of pork lathered in red mole michoacano sauce. The pork wasn&#39;t particularly special and while the sauce was interesting, the dish was just average.The staff is friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well-maintained. The restaurant is located a couple of miles away from Monterey&#39;s touristy downtown area, so it&#39;s conveniently close, but far away enough that parking isn&#39;t a pain.

            If you&#39;re looking for a challenging hike with great views, drop by Toro Park. I ran the Spartan Beast here -- a grueling 13 mile journey up and down its many hills, with obstacles sprinkled throughout. The park offered great terrain and views for the journey. The starting area was on a flat, grass-filled area that would be great for picnics and lounging. The trails wound up and down large hills, exposing drier terrain and providing excellent views. It can get pretty warm here, and there isn&#39;t much shade up on the hills, so be sure to pack water and wear sunscreen.

            Cafe La Strada offers decent baked goods, but consider yourself warned! Do NOT be stupid like us and bring your baked goods outside... and tempt the vicious sea gulls.I was enjoying a moist, berry-filled Blueberry Muffin when an audacious seagull jumped onto our table and snatched my Strawberry Cheese Danish right from my hand. We proceeded to watch the thief uncomfortably swallow the danish in one gulp, and spent a few minutes wondering if it was going to choke and die in front of us. When it seemed to be okay (although with a huge bulging throat), we went inside to get another danish. We made sure to stay inside this time. The danish was filled with cream cheese and a thin layer of strawberry filling that surprisingly provided just the right amount of strawberry flavor. I&#39;m sure the sea gull enjoyed it as much as I did.Be careful out there everyone!

            The Monterey Bay Aquarium does an excellent job of covering amazing and diverse aquatic wildlife. The aquarium is packed with awesome exhibits including areas dedicated just to jelly fish and seahorses. There are also two massive tanks: the Kelp Forest -- one of the tallest aquarium exhibits in the world -- and the Open Sea, which features a mind-boggling 90-foot viewing window. Prepare to spend a couple of hours exploring every nook and cranny of this aquarium because it is totally worth it. The bay and ocean is home to some interesting forms of life that truly boggle the mind. The aquarium is wildly popular, and right in the tourist trap of Cannery Row, so expect the place to be packed with visitors. You&#39;ll have to wait a few minutes at each exhibit for a chance to look at the wildlife up close. Also, expect to pay an arm and a leg for parking. Not a huge deal, but prepare to endure a frustrated search.And now, time for an educational rant. For some mind-boggling reason, it seems visitors love watching the &#34;cute&#34; sea otters. I know the aquarium is supposed to be family friendly, but I wish there would was some education about the uglier side of otters. They are intelligent enough (like humans, monkeys, and dolphins) to get a twisted joy out of doing messed up stuff. Just between 2000 and 2002 there were fifteen documented cases of sadistic otters raping, and during the process killing, baby harbor seals right in the Monterey Bay!

            My liver cried out in pain as I entered Candy Baron and saw tubs and tubs filled with candy. I&#39;ve outgrown my childhood love of candy (that is, my addiction), but enjoyed revisiting some old classics like sour belts, gummi bears, and Swedish fish. Candy Baron offers eight different flavors of sour belts! The cr√®me br√ªl√©e and pumpkin pie fudge was so rich I had trouble taking a second bite. Unlike my seven year old former self, I didn&#39;t dare try to finish it.

            I tried four of the eight flavors YoghArt offered and was generally unimpressed. The Country Vanilla flavor was disappointingly bland, and a bit tart, which I don&#39;t particularly like. Cheesecake wasn&#39;t true to its name, yet it still tasted good so I didn&#39;t mind. That said, it wasn&#39;t all bad. The Birthday Cake actually tasted like a birthday cake, and the Sweet Coconut was light and may have had a few chunks of actual coconut in it. The people working here were extremely friendly, yet the frozen yogurt left something to be desired.

            Garlic City Cafe does great justice to Gilroy&#39;s claim to fame: garlic.The Garlic City Burger (half pound of angus ground chuck, sweet roasted garlic, and Gorgonzola mayonnaise) was the highlight of our meal. It came loaded with about 20 cloves of garlic, yet the flavor of this burger was the powerful Gorgonzola mayonnaise. Each bite of this burger just melted in your mouth, with a little hint of garlic, and a wave of strong, creamy Gorgonzola Mayonnaise.The bowl of Signature Soup Cream of Garlic was great. It offered a thick texture with satisfying garlicky flavor that wasn&#39;t too overpowering. The Garlic Chicken and Eggplant Panini (grilled chicken, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, smoked mozzarella, pesto spread) was also good. It was an enjoyable sandwich, but paled in comparison to the amazing burger.Garlic City Cafe reminded me of the diners from back home in New Jersey, with a garlicky twist. If you ever find yourself in Gilroy, stop by this gem of a restaurant.

            The service staff here is friendly, helpful, and professional. Getting an appointment is easy, and they work fast. Anytime something was found during the factory-scheduled maintenance, I would get a call explaining the issue, and an estimate of the damage to my wallet before they would proceed with fixing any issues. A few days after my service appointment, they usually follow up with a quick call to make sure everything was done to my satisfaction.Spending money getting your car serviced doesn&#39;t make many people happy and this place is definitely a bit more expensive than some general auto repair shops. That said, aside from my visits for factory-scheduled maintenance, I&#39;ve had zero problems with my car -- probably a testament to their competency.

            If I was craving awesome donuts, Happy Donuts would not be destination. But if I wanted a place to hang out with friends, surf the interwebs, and eat some fattening fried dough, Happy Donuts is the place to be. Happy Donuts offers fast, free, wireless internet that is actually fast. No passwords, no dumb web forms that make you agree to sell your soul, and no traffic shaping. With a decent ping and fast download and upload speeds, you can bring friends to play some StarCraft 2, or get some less serious work done. The donuts are okay. During my last visit I tried a Glazed Donut Hole, a Raspberry Filled Donut Hole, and a Blueberry Cream Cheese Fritter. The donut holes were soft, and covered in a thin, sugary glaze. The raspberry filled donut hole should&#39;ve been called Raspberry-Stuffed Donut Hole because it was absolutely packed with sweet raspberry jam. The fritter was filled with a light cream cheese, and provided a nice mix of soft pastry, blueberry filling, and creamy flavor.

            Unlike the Whole Foods in San Mateo, this store doesn&#39;t suffer from annoying inventory issues. Every time I stop by for things I couldn&#39;t pick up in San Mateo, I am pleasantly surprised to find a healthy supply of everything I want.The checkout area is a bit odd. There are two separate lines that combine into a single lane that has multiple registers. When the lanes merge, people alternate hopping into the checkout area. In general, aim for the shorter of the two lines to get out faster. I can imagine this would cause mini world wars in an angry, merge-incompetent place like New Jersey, but it seems to work okay with the friendly people in San Francisco.

            Street Food offers a la carte Beijing-style skewers and other small dishes. For about $1 you can pick from about 70 different skewers! Because of the economical price, there is no need to bring a large party to sample their menu.My favorite item was the BBQ Eggplant. For only $2, we got a large serving of creamy, well-seasoned eggplant. The eggplant was so rich and creamy I had a hard time believing I was actually eating a vegetable. The Shredded Dried Bean Curd provided an excellent reprieve from the onslaught of spicy skewers. My dining partner was blown away by the BBQ Oyster. Not only was the oyster absolutely massive, the spicy broth complemented the taste of the oyster, rather than overpowering it.The Wontons in Chili Sauce, with a scant amount of bland meat, was very underwhelming, and was actually the most expensive item on our tab. This seemed like the only disappointing dish.We were pleased with our visit here. We got to sample a ton of different skewers, yet we only explored a fraction of their offerings. If we&#39;re ever craving skewers, or delicious eggplant, we&#39;ll stop by Street Food again.

            My friend and I dropped by for an afternoon snack at Golden Island Cafe, and were pleasantly surprised by things we ordered. My hot Hong Kong Style Tea wasn&#39;t sweet. In fact, it was a bit bitter, but I enjoyed it. My friend got a Papaya Milk Smoothie with Tapioca, which was cool and creamy. We&#39;re not sure if it&#39;s actually made with real papaya, but it certainly tasted like they had just blended one just for this smoothie. The Sago with Coconut Milk is a traditional Asian dessert featuring coconut milk, small sago pearls, and small cubes of grass jelly. To be honest, I haven&#39;t yet acquired a taste Asian-style desserts, but I actually really liked this item. The cool, smooth, sweet coconut milk complemented the grass jelly by masking the jelly&#39;s slight bitterness. The bounty of sago pearls added to the mixture of textures in this dish.We also tried a Hot Dessert Sampler. This comes with some Sweet Peanut Dumpling (mochi with ground peanuts), Dun Dan (steamed egg custard), Dun Lai (steamed milk custard), and Sesame Paste. The Dun Dan was a bit too eggy for me, but I enjoyed the Dun Lai. My friend really enjoyed the gooey mochi and crunchy peanuts of the Peanut Dumplings.My friend went on a serious nostalgia trip of his time in Asia while we were here. On our way out, we looked at the menu near the entrance, which features pictures of the entr√©es and snacks Golden Island offers. So many things looked mouth-watering, so we&#39;re planning on coming back with empty stomachs!

            Quickly&#39;s tea won&#39;t blow your mind, but it isn&#39;t bad. I asked for a standard Milk Bubble Tea that I enjoyed, with my preferred level of sweetness. They seem to have tapioca supply-chain issues: I stopped by after lunch and they were already out of regular-size tapioca, so I got smaller boba. The wait wasn&#39;t long, although I felt bad for the girl who had to both man the register and make the teas. This Quickly has a massive menu. I was already full when I visited, so I skipped out on trying their Peanut Butter Piggy Bun. It sounds interesting, so I&#39;m planning to try it during my next visit.

            J&amp;J Bakery serves up Hong Kong style entr√©es, and Chinese baked goods, including my favorite item: BBQ Pork Buns. The Baked BBQ Pork Bun is huge. I was expecting to get a small amount of pork inside the sweet, fluffy, chewy bread of this bun. But I was pleasantly surprised to find it packed with a mixture of pork chunks and shredded pork. The meat wasn&#39;t swimming in sauce, but that didn&#39;t take away from this awesome bun.Aside from the pork bun, I tried a few of their other baked goods and got mixed results. The Sausage Bun features a decent savory sausage (not a traditionally sweet one) wrapped in a sweet, soft bun. The lightly sweet Sponge Cake was so airy, it melted in my mouth. The Pineapple Bread was sweet and light in texture, but didn&#39;t pack any discernible taste. The Walnut Cookie was a bit too hard. When I bit into it, I was surprised by my cookie-dwelling archenemy: chocolate chips.

            The quirkily named Champagne Restaurant serves great dim sum and Cantonese dishes. I came here with three friends for lunch on a Saturday. We ordered a small feast, and this restaurant delivered a number of impressive items. My favorite dish here is the Deep-Fried Pumpkin with Salted Egg Yolk -- which is basically like pumpkin fries. The pumpkin is so juicy and soft. The breading has small pieces of egg yolk that complement the pumpkin extremely well. The Fried Salt and Pepper Diced Tofu is magical and paradoxical in nature. Even though it&#39;s fried, the small tofu bites are so lightly fried, they almost seem baked. Fried goods are usually kept moist by covering them in a layer of breading. The tofu in this dish had a minimal coat of breading, yet the inside was somehow incredibly moist and creamy. I was impressed just eating the tofu, but then I ate the tofu with the pepper, garlic, and scallion seasoning, and was absolutely floored by the bonanza of flavors and textures. The Shanghai Soup Dumplings are great, and packed with hot broth. The Steamed BBQ Pork Buns feature soft, fluffy bread enclosing juicy chunks of pork. The fried Crispy Taro Puffs come with a heaping amount of melt-in-your-mouth taro, blowing away my expectations for the dish.It&#39;s a shame Champagne Restaurant doesn&#39;t serve champagne, because by the end of our meal, we were ready to celebrate the successful, delicious meal.

            When the springring clasp on my necklace broke, I brought it in to White Dove to get it fixed. John was extremely helpful and gave me his recommendation: replace it with a lobster clasp, which is much stronger than the original clasp. He charged me for the new lobster clasp -- but made the repairs and even cleaned my entire necklace for free. My experience was painless and enjoyable; anytime I need jewelry fixed or cleaned, White Dove will be my destination and I wholly recommend it.

            If you want your pick from a variety of well-made crepes and awesome gelato, stop at the cozy Crepe Stop. My dining partner ordered a Wake Up Call (Cheese, Egg, Bacon, Sour Cream) and it looked too good, so I stole a bite... or two! It was superb: the cheese, egg, and bacon were all complemented by a light layer of sour cream, making this crepe an absolute winner.I ordered a Philly Cheese Crepe (Mozzarella, Tri-Tip, Bell Pepper, Onion). I like my Philly Cheesesteaks with mushrooms. Fortunately, they let you customize your crepe so I got my crepe exactly as I desired. The crepe was enjoyable: a nice mix of the sweet pancake and savory stuff inside. But it was a bit dry, so next time I&#39;ll ask for some tomato or sour cream.The crepes were great and the gelato didn&#39;t disappoint. The Strawberry Cheesecake was rich, smooth, and flavorful. Compared to this, the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e had a more subdued taste. My dining partner thoroughly enjoyed the Tiramisu gelato. The crepes aren&#39;t huge, so you can comfortably enjoy one with some gelato; or, if you are dining with a partner, order three crepes to share! With 30 crepes (plus the option to build your own) and 20 flavors of gelato, we&#39;ll definitely be dropping by The Crepe Stop again!

            Amami provides okay late-night sushi; nothing blew me away, but at the same time, nothing was disappointing.The Gyoza (pan-fried pot stickers) seemed to only get pan fried on one side, and the other side was soft, or if judged more harshly: soggy. The Chicken Kara-age (Japanese style fried chicken) was spot on: full of flavor and crispy.The Seared Baby Lobster looked great, but it came with a hidden mountain of wasabi that gave me &#34;surprise wasabi flairs&#34; while eating it. The Crab Lover Roll (soft shell crab topped with avocado, snow crab) was mediocre. The mix of the warm crab inside and cold avocado on top just didn&#39;t work well. Topping the entire roll with an overly sweet sauce also didn&#39;t help. The Wild Boy Roll (spicy tuna, avocado, topped with scallop, tobiko, and creamy wasabi sauce) fared a bit better, but the large amount of spicy tuna in this roll overpowered the other flavors. The uninspiring Green Tea and Sesame Ice Cream solidified Amami as an okay sushi place. If it&#39;s late in the evening, and you&#39;re craving sushi, give Amami a try. Otherwise, you can do better.

            Thai House provides excellent service, an awesome atmosphere, but the most critical element -- the food -- is a mixed bag.My dining party shared a few appetizers. The Fried Calamari was my favorite; it was nicely seasoned with that Thai spicy kick. The Crispy Taro Fries was what I expected out of fried taro: something akin to a tasteless potato chip. The Crispy Tofu was really disappointing. The outside wasn&#39;t very crispy, and the inside was very soggy.My Pumpkin Curry was okay: the chicken was a bit too dry, but the pieces of pumpkin were cooked just right. The Salmon Fillet Wrapped in Banana Leaves came with salmon that was completely overpowered by peppery spices. My dining partner got the Crispy Pork Belly special. She thought the meat seemed overcooked and was hard to chew, but I thought it was just right.Thai House has got everything else figured out, so it stands to benefit greatly from improvements to its food offerings.

            I&#39;m a total weirdo and don&#39;t like chocolate, so my options at Anthony&#39;s Cookies were severely limited, especially since they were out of Oatmeal Raisin Cookies when I visited.So, I had the Cinnamon Spice, Walnut Chip, and White Chocolate Chip cookies. My favorite was the Walnut Chip cookie, which was was small, chunky, and packed with walnuts. The White Chocolate Chip cookie was a bit too sweet, even for me. Generally, the cookies were good: soft and moist on the inside. I was expecting them to be served warm, which would have been great given how chilly it was outside. This definitely may be a case of &#34;it&#39;s me, not you, Anthony.&#34; Although it didn&#39;t blow me away, if you&#39;re looking for good cookies, give Anthony&#39;s a shot.

            Bi-Rite serves up top notch ice cream. My triple scoop of Vanilla Bean, Balsamic Strawberry, and Cheesecake with Blueberry Swirl was expeditiously consumed. The Balsamic Strawberry, my favorite flavor, was shockingly true to its name; the holy union of tart and sweet flavors was well-executed. If you stop at the window shop next to the main store, you can get soft serve. They do two different flavors each day of the week. I had a soft serve bowl of Honey and it was delicious. The consistency was perfect: soft and fluid, but not runny. I&#39;ll definitely have to come back on a Wednesday, when they&#39;ll be serving Peanut Butter and Roasted Banana!

            Dr. Ezzat-Velinov or Mona -- as she casually introduced herself -- is a great doctor.Fortunately, I am in good health, so doctors usually send me on my way after checking my vitals. But during my checkup, we had a thorough discussion, and made a list of lifestyle changes to improve my health. Mona didn&#39;t take me on a guilt trip when I told her I don&#39;t eat many leafy greens, but encouraged me to try eating them once or twice a week; something I can definitely aim to do. Hopefully, I won&#39;t have to see Mona until my next checkup, but I&#39;m certainly looking forward to talking to her again.If you&#39;re considering checking out One Medical, do it. If you want a great doctor, schedule an appointment with Mona.

            Teaven offers a varied selection of items: milk tea, tea, shaved ice, yogurt, and even fried snacks. Their Milk Tea is a bit on the sweet side, but that didn&#39;t stop me from thoroughly enjoying mine.Beware of ordering during their Happy Hour (Sunday - Thursday, 7 PM onwards) as you will get a free size upgrade for your drink. Wait... How could this be bad? I assumed they would give me the drink size I pointed at -- except it would be discounted to the price of a smaller size. Instead, I picked one size and they served me with a larger size. And these sizes are extremely awkward -- I ordered a Prince size and they gave me a Queen. The Queen size looks more like a bowl than a cup, and was even more awkward to hold. It&#39;s not the worst surprise, but if you&#39;re trying to manage your intake of tea, it might be good to check the exact size you&#39;re going to end up with.

            Garaje offers American and Mexican dishes in a wonderful harmony.The Crazy Dave&#39;s Double Cheeseburger is massive: two quarter pounds of angus beef topped with cheddar cheese and optionally, but certainly recommended, bacon. The meat in this cheeseburger was juicy, tender, and in charge.Order the Carne Asada Fries and you&#39;ll get a heaping serving of fries topped with grilled beef, jack cheese, avocado, and pico. I advise against thinking of this dish as a mere appetizer, so bring people to share with. The star here is the carne asada; normally, the beef is finely chopped, but at Garaje, you&#39;ll get large, juicy chunks of beef. The menu features a plethora of tempting items. On my next visit, I&#39;m looking forward to trying the Carnitas Zapato (Burrito).

            One Medical is what I expect out of a doctor&#39;s visit in the 21st century. I signed up online, created a profile, filled out my medical history questionnaire, and booked an appointment, all within half an hour. The day before my appointment, I got a friendly email reminder.My appointment started exactly on time. My check-up with Dr. Ezzat-Velinov (who introduced herself as Mona) was picture perfect: she was kind, professional, and we talked about things I could do to improve my health. I also got blood work done here. Again, I didn&#39;t have to wait, and even got some bandage that didn&#39;t painfully rip hair off of my arm when removed! A copy of the blood work results arrived a week later via email, with interpretation by my doctor.There is a yearly $149 membership fee, but it&#39;s totally worth the convenience of fast, on-time, same-day appointments at any of their 14 offices in the Bay Area. To illustrate this point: I&#39;m writing this at 5:30 PM on a Friday. I just checked appointment availability, and could actually see a doctor TODAY in San Francisco, Burlingame, or Sunnyvale!

            Twelve flavors on tap, ridiculous selection of toppings, and waffle bowls make Nubi a great place to satisfy your froyo cravings.During my first visit, I took a purist approach and skipped all the toppings and sampled four different frozen yogurt flavors. The Wild Berry was berry, berry good; the flavor Force was berry strong with this one. The Vanilla also tasted strongly of vanilla bean. The Cake Batter&#39;s flavor was unfortunately too subtle and didn&#39;t fulfill my dreams of tasting like real cake batter. That said, the Birthday Cake flavor did a good job of covering Cake Batter&#39;s inadequacies!It&#39;ll take many, many visits to try everything, and I&#39;m okay with that!

            It&#39;s not just hype; Tpumps makes great bubble tea to your exact specification. The Black Milk Tea is more than a mixture of black tea and milk. With every sip, you taste each dimension of flavor of the tea: a taste of cool tea followed by a wave of sweet milk. We also got a Strawberry Tea with Milk and Popping Lychee Boba. I was expecting something akin to strawberry milk, but got a refreshing strawberry juice mixed with milk. Each popping boba added a burst of sweet, refreshing lychee. Although it wasn&#39;t what I was expecting, it was still quite enjoyable.If you&#39;re lucky and the line isn&#39;t out the door, you&#39;ll only need about 20 minutes to order and get your bubble tea. I&#39;m no bubble tea connoisseur, but if the line is out the door, I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s worth waiting.

            Oh my goodness... Their Fried Ahi is absolutely delicious! An order comes with two pieces of excellently seasoned, lightly fried, tender ahi.The Fried Oysters tasted fresh. The taste of the breading was more subdued compared to the Fried Ahi, but that let the wonderful taste of the oysters shine through. If you like salmon roe, the San Mateo Roll (shrimp tempura, salmon, salmon roe, tobiko) is a great deep-fried roll loaded with it. The Chicken Kara-age was average and didn&#39;t stand out. This place definitely impressed. We&#39;ll be back to get some more Fried Aji, and explore the rest of their offerings.

I was expecting a dud or two, but was pleasantly surprised to find that every dish was prepared well and enjoyed thoroughly by all.The Salt and Pepper Pork Chop was my favorite dish. The pork was tender, well-seasoned, and lightly fried. The thick-skinned Pot Stickers were unique: they looked baked instead of pan-fried, and the skin looked like bread. Although they were good, I was a little disappointed to find out they tasted no different from regular pot stickers.The service was great, and to my surprise, we didn&#39;t get dirty looks when we handed them multiple credit cards.

            This bakery has a diversified portfolio, doing many different things rather well. The Baked BBQ Pork Buns were nicely toasted, and filled with fluffy breading and tender meat, but were tainted with unnecessary food coloring. The comparatively smaller Steamed BBQ Pork Buns were morsels of soft, chewy bread and contained little chunks of pork -- without food coloring. The Egg Custard Tarts were excellent. The crust was soft, and broke apart into crumbs easily, facilitating the &#34;melt in your mouth&#34; experience. Unlike tarts at other bakeries, the creamy filling was not very runny, which I appreciated, given the crumble-prone crust.The Ham and Cheese Bun and Chinese Sausage Bun weren&#39;t that impressive; they didn&#39;t provide any compelling blend of the ingredients&#39; flavors. The Chicken Bun had baking paper that insisted on sticking to the bun. To top off your experience with all these baked goods, be sure to grab a hot cup of the creamy Hong Kong Milk Tea!

            The Bread Basket comes with some truly magical Herb Infused Butter. If their menu wasn&#39;t filled with delicious items, I&#39;d be tempted to just keep ordering basket after basket of bread!Our party shared an order of Reibekuchen (Potato Pancakes with Apple Compote). The pancakes were crispy on the outside, soft inside, and the apple compote was sweet with a subtle honey mustard kick to it.The Bratwurst Sandwich (Grilled Bratwurst, Sauerkraut, German Mustard on a Toasted Baguette) was excellent. The spicy German Mustard was a bit overpowering at times, making my sinuses flair, but it was so good, I didn&#39;t even mind! I devoured the sandwich and the side of Roasted Potatoes with Bacon.The worst part about Speisekammer was picking the one entree I wanted to eat! Fortunately, things like this can be remedied with future visits, which I definitely plan on making.

            Get me a Milk Tea and Roti Bun from Honey Berry and I&#39;m one happy guy. The Milk Tea isn&#39;t too sweet, and has chewy tapioca. The Yogurt Chip Cream Cheese Roti Bun is a big, fluffy bun filled with warm cream cheese. The bun is bigger than the stuff inside, as it&#39;s filled with a good amount of air; it&#39;d be nice to get some more bread or cream cheese inside. That said, the bun and tea are a match made in heaven!Also, people say I smile a lot, but I think the guy who works here smiles more than me and has the most infectious smile! It definitely motivates me to keep on smiling.

            I avoid getting gas here because the price is higher than other stations in the area, but I can wholly recommend their service center. When air was leaking from one of my tires, they quickly diagnosed and fixed the issue. When I needed a smog check, I grabbed the coupon off their website, and paid only $37.

            Although it&#39;s only a few blocks away from my favorite intersection in the city, 6th and Market, I&#39;d definitely come back to this place for some late-night grub.My dining partner and I shared an order of Potato Skins, a Box Burger, and a Chicken in Waffles. Of these items, the Chicken in Waffles was the highlight of our meal. We thought the chicken was forgotten in our order, but the chicken is literally in the waffle! The blending of savory and sweet in this meal was executed extremely well: the waffle and chicken, and maple syrup mixed with Sriracha sauce all came together in a pleasantly novel way.

            Any time there was a hiccup in my health, I could always count on Dr. Ferraz to see me through it. He was the pediatrician for me, my sister, and my extended family who lived in and around the Ironbound area. We have nothing but praise for Dr. Ferraz and his team.His office is ridiculously busy on most days. You can call for an appointment when they open at noon, but everything feels like it operates on a first-come, first-served basis. Your appointment is a guess of when things might be less busy. If your situation is not extremely urgent, your best bet is to call, ask for the latest available appointment, and drop by then.I relocated to California. I still see my dentist in Newark (Dr. Gultz), since I visit home roughly every 6 months. I really wish I could do the same with Dr. Ferraz, but -- for better or worse -- illness doesn&#39;t come on a regular schedule!

            Dear God... Don&#39;t bring just a friend; bring your entire family because you&#39;ll need help getting through the ridiculously large portions here.I got a triple scoop of Vanilla Bean, Strawberry, and Blueberry Cheesecake. The cup was large, yet the vast amount of ice cream was still overflowing the edges; I had to rush to eat it so it didn&#39;t drop out. The three flavors were all good. But the Vanilla and Strawberry were exceptional, which was surprising given how good the Blueberry Cheesecake was!We didn&#39;t get frozen yogurt or soft serve, but don&#39;t worry. We&#39;ll definitely be coming back!

            Woah... Finally I, a Portuguese Custard Cup snob, found custard cups in the Bay Area that didn&#39;t disappoint me! Although the crust on the custard cups here isn&#39;t as flaky as traditional Portuguese ones, their creamy filling was spot on. While here, I picked up their Walnut Cookies, which I quickly devoured. I also grabbed a Pork Sung Bun (made by Suzanne&#39;s Bakery) and was disappointed with how little pork filling there was.

            Man, their Croissants are large and in charge. I picked up a bag of them at Banh Mi Ba Le, located down the street from Biuphong. Banh Mi stocks their Croissants and Butter Biscuits and is open later, so don&#39;t fret if you need your fix after this bakery closes.The Croissants (at least the packaged ones I got) aren&#39;t crispy like traditional croissants, but they were definitely fresh and definitely amazing. Very soft, with just the right amount of that buttery taste you expect, their large Croissants beg to be pulled apart and enjoyed with a glass of coffee or milk.I definitely want to drop by and see what else they offer, and if the in-house Croissants are any different from the packaged ones I picked up at Banh Mi.

            We came here to grab the amazing Croissants made by Buiphong Bakery. Buiphong closes at 1 PM on Saturday, but Banh Mi is open until 4 PM, so if you need to satisfy your Buiphong Croissant addiction, just come here. I&#39;m a big fan of Chinese-style BBQ Porked Buns so when I saw a bunch of packaged Steam Buns, I jumped for joy and grabbed some. I got home, wrapped it in a moist paper towel, and threw it in the microwave for a minute. I opened the bun up to find a hard-boiled egg and Vietnamese-style meatball infused with carrots and peas. The bread was soft and proved to be a good vessel for the interesting mixture of ingredients inside. I also grabbed a Taro Jelly Drink. The accompanying &#34;granola&#34; was made of crushed peanuts and the bottom was filled with slices of banana. The jelly tasted very much like taro and I enjoyed the entire drink. We came here after eating lunch so we didn&#39;t have room to try the B√°nh M√¨ (Vietnamese-style sandwiches) this place is known for. Don&#39;t worry... I&#39;ll be back!

            We rolled into this place, ordered a bunch of appetizers and entr√©es, and ate it family style. Overall, my dining partners and I were very impressed with every item that came out.The Spicy Papaya Salad with Shrimp appetizer wasn&#39;t very spicy, but it was refreshing; even with a misleading name, this salad was great. It was topped with peanut crumbs, which added an extra dimension to the flavors and textures of the vegetables and shrimp. Although called Deep Fried Calamari, this appetizer didn&#39;t have an oily taste at all. The pieces of calamari were surprisingly large and the breading was well seasoned.The Kary Tia (Duck with Potatoes, Green Beans in Green Curry) features three large pieces of succulent duck in a light curry sauce. This entr√©e comes with a heaping serving of rice, which was more than enough to go with the curry. The Saut√©ed Eggplant and Chicken (Daily Special) had eggplant that wasn&#39;t soggy, as I&#39;m usually used to. The Slaap Moarn Borg featured three boneless chicken wings stuffed with lots of vegetables and lemongrass spices. Both entr√©es were great. Even the Thai Iced Tea wasn&#39;t too sweet, which is par at most restaurants. In short, everything was great.

            My first visit here yielded mixed results. The menu is eclectic: offering omelets, crepes, bubble, fruit juice, jelly drink, tea, ice cream, mochi, Asian-style desserts, and fried snacks like Popcorn Chicken and French Fries. During this visit, I tried the ice cream and bubble tea.Their ice cream was great. I got the Vanilla and Strawberry. Both flavors were true to their name, rich, and refreshing. My dining partner had the Chocolate Orange Chip and was really impressed it, remarking that it offered a great blend of textures. The bubble tea wasn&#39;t too impressive. It was made with powder and they put shaved ice in it. Shaved ice melts faster than ice cubes, so by the time I got to the end of my drink, a good amount of ice had already melted and it tasted watered down.The servers were personable and friendly, but seemed a bit disorganized; I&#39;m not sure if they were flustered with the crowd that came in with me and just needed someone to help direct them. That said, the menu covers a ton of items so I&#39;m planning to drop by again to try their crepes and fried snacks.

            Triumph played a formative part in my college life, since once a month, my roommates and I would come here for burgers and beer. Triumph also taught me that beer doesn&#39;t have to taste bad; beer can actually be really tasty!The Triumph Burger with grass-fed beef is pretty great, and they actually cook it as you request it. I always topped mine with Swiss Cheese, Grilled Onions, and Mushrooms. The best part of this entr√©e is the Chipotle Mayonnaise. This magical sauce goes well with everything: burger, fries, vegetables, and anything else you order here. I once even asked for a &#34;tub of Chipotle Mayonnaise&#34; and our server delivered by bringing out a large ramekin filled with this heavenly concoction!The beers are also great! My favorite beer there is the Amber Ale, which is normally available year-round. While all their beers are worth trying, the Honey Blonde reminded me too much of watered-down college beer. If it&#39;s your first time here, go with the Sampler to get a taste of all the beers they have on tap.Every time I find myself back in Princeton, especially when old friends are around, I always try to drop by Triumph for a great burger and beer.

            Like the Power Rangers say, &#34;It&#39;s Morphin&#39; Time&#34; when they are ready to take on some bad guys, I excitedly proclaimed, &#34;It&#39;s Carbo-Loadin&#39; Time&#34; as we stepped into this small Guatemalan bakery. We got some baked bread. Just a hint of sweetness, these firm panes would be great with a cup of milk or coffee. I made the mistake of eating the panes by themselves, which did not do them justice, as they tasted a bit dry.My favorite item was the mil hojas (thousand sheets): a delicious confectionery built with alternating layers of whipped cream and flaky pastry with powdered sugar on top. A bite of the light, fluffy cream and pastry flakes creates an amazing blend of textures in your mouth.We also tried the Pork and Chicken Tamales that were both good. They aren&#39;t huge so they can comfortably complement any other items you are interested in. They do come with bones so don&#39;t inhale your tamale! Piqued by how good everything was, we also wanted to try out the Chicken Quesadilla, Chicken Burrito, and Pan con Frijoles, Queso, Huevo (Bread with Beans, Cheese, Egg), but the server told us they only serve those items in the morning. I guess I&#39;ll have to make a stop here in the morning one day.

            I do most of my grocery shopping at this Whole Foods. The produce is fresh, their inventory usually covers my needs, and the staff is friendly and always eager to help. They don&#39;t ever stock the large 64 ounce Eggology Egg Whites, so I pick these up at the San Francisco Whole Foods. There was a period when they did not have any Brat Hans Chicken Burgers. I asked about it and was told they were reorganizing their meats area and would have them in stock in a month; true to their word, they are now always in stock.The store has a lot of gluten-free options, which is great if you are buying for someone who has a gluten sensitivity.Also, some of the items from their Prepared Foods section are good. I really like the Tomato Basil Bisque and Cream of Mushroom soup, and their Teriyaki Tofu is delicious.

            This place is so popular. If you wanted to schedule an appointment today, you&#39;d be lucky if you can get in within the month. This isn&#39;t hype; it&#39;s proof that Eyeworks of San Mateo provides excellent service.I came in with my friend to get a checkup and an update for my prescription. Dr. Lai not only took care of my eyes in a thorough and professional manner, he was extremely friendly and talked to my friend and I about all sorts of things. Afterwards, we picked out frames and just when you thought this place couldn&#39;t get better, you&#39;re proven wrong!! Mitch patiently guided us through the myriad of frames available at the store and was totally clutch in helping us pick out the perfect frame. With frame in hand, Mitch made some measurements, and a few days later I picked up glasses that fit me perfectly.Thanks Eyeworks! Very much looking forward to my next visit.

            I&#39;m not a big fan of collectable card games (e.g. Magic, Pok√©mon), but I think that&#39;s because I didn&#39;t grow up in a neighborhood with a place like D20 Games.To satisfy my curiosity, I strolled into D20 on a Saturday afternoon. The place was bustling with a younger crowd playing games and checking out the cards for sale. Right next to the entrance is a calendar packed with events.The store owner, Ben, quickly introduced himself and asked what brought me in. When I told him I was more of a video gamer, he didn&#39;t shun me, but talked about how he was once a video game programmer. We had a pleasant chat about his past career and what card games were popular these days. He invited me to look around and holler at him with any questions. When someone wanted to buy a card I was surprised and happy to see that Ben looked up prices online (with the monitor facing both him and the customer) and gave them the average price he found online.More than just a store that sells cards, D20 Games seems like a great place for kids (and adults) to hang out and engage in some old-school face-to-face gaming. If that&#39;s your kind of thing, definitely check out D20.

            If there&#39;s one cuisine I haven&#39;t been able to find in the Bay Area, it&#39;s a &#34;totally unhealthy, but so delicious&#34; hoagie like those served at Hoagie Haven. During school, I had a love-hate relationship with the Phat Lady -- a cheese steak sandwich with mozzarella sticks and french fries. I loved how the layers of meat and fried goods blended in my mouth, but hated how it made my heart and arteries cry out in pain. That didn&#39;t stop me from eating this wonderful creation far more often than I should have.The bread -- vessel of goodness -- is a plain Italian white loaf. It&#39;s not bad, but I think there is some opportunity for improvement. I hope I can one day enjoy a Phat Lady on a loaf seasoned in garlic and covered in Asiago cheese.They also do build-to-order sandwiches. Once, I was craving hot dogs. When I walked into Hoagie Haven, I decided I didn&#39;t just want a plain old hotdog, but one with french fries, mozzarella sticks, and chicken nuggets. It was delicious!Since I graduated, it seems like they have done some culinary experiments and have discovered deep frying chunks of Mac n&#39; Cheese. During a recent visit, I tried the Mac Daddy - a Bacon Cheeseburger with deep fried Mac n&#39; Cheese wedges, french fries, and honey mustard. Let&#39;s just say the Phat Lady now has some serious competition for my favorite artery-clogging hoagie!My arteries don&#39;t miss you Hoagie Haven, but not a day (okay, maybe week) goes by that I don&#39;t think about biting into a delicious, greasy hoagie!

            Dr. Gultz has a fantastic team: helpful, kind staff at the front desk; friendly, professional dentists; and even Dr. Gultz himself, who is a totally awesome, down-to-Earth guy who loves chatting up a storm. Everyone here is an absolute pleasure to interact with. My family has been going to his office for 20+ years and we have nothing but high praise for his team.I moved out to California in 2010, but conveniently find myself back in New Jersey every 6 months for college reunions and holidays with the family. Instead of searching for a dentist that would not live up to Dr. Gultz, I just make sure to schedule a visit when I&#39;m back east.I&#39;ll have to ask during my next visit, but I think I have the longest commute to his office -- 6 hours on a plane!

            The variety and selection here is absolutely ridiculous, but there&#39;s a lot about this store that holds back its potential.Games are organized by console, but that&#39;s about it. The games on the shelves along the right-side of the store can be browsed up close, but it seems all the good games are on the left-side behind a counter. You&#39;ll need good eyesight, and hope that there aren&#39;t random item blocking the games. Fortunately, the lady working here didn&#39;t seem to mind grabbing games and checking prices for me.Speaking of prices, here are some examples of ridiculous prices:Valkyria Chronicles (PS3) - $20 NEW on Amazon, $38.99 USED here.Xenogears (PSX) - $40 on eBay, $99.99 here.Metal Gear Solid (PSX) - $10 on eBay, $26.99 here.That said, decent deals can be had here. Secret of Mana (SNES) for $59.99 and Skies of Arcadia (GCN) for $69.99 is very reasonable. I saw a sealed copy of ZHP Unlosing Ranger vs Darkdeath Evilman (PSP), which starts at $60 on eBay. The lady told me it normally cost $39.99, but she would give me a $10 discount. SOLD!Moral of the story: Bring a device to check prices, and come with plenty of time since you&#39;ll be searching through an unorganized trove for a potentially great deal!

            The service here is top notch: we were greeted by an enthusiastic server, who offered samples as soon as we muttered the name of any flavor. I got three scoops in a cup: Raspberry Cheesecake, Green Tea, and Vanilla Bean. The flavor that I usually use as a standard for measuring ice cream places -- Vanilla Bean -- didn&#39;t really impress me. But the Raspberry Cheesecake was so rich and flavorful that it made up for that.My dining partner enjoyed a double scoop of Mocha Almond Chips, which has slivers of almonds in it.

            Ark Restaurant has changed my opinion of noodles. I&#39;m not a huge fan of noodles -- but only if the noodles aren&#39;t handmade and made-to-order, like they are at Ark. I had the Cold Noodles with Shredded Pork: a heaping amount of long, thin, soft noodles with shredded pork and noodled cucumber, covered in a vinegar-based sauce. Even though you get a large amount of noodles, the dish is amazingly light; I didn&#39;t feel the sluggishness I normally feel after consuming a bowl of noodles. Every ingredient played its part in making this dish great, especially the vinegar that gave every slurp and bite a tangy kick. My dining partners and I shared an order of Juicy Pork Steam Dumplings (xiao long bao). The skin of these dumplings was a little too thick, which overpowered the flavor of the pork inside. I love any dishes with pumpkin, so I&#39;ll be back to try their Pumpkin Porridge. The only problem is that I&#39;ll be too full to order their awesome noodles!

The bread on these sandwiches is so soft and fluffy, it looks like they pump them full of air before serving them! The meat packed within is absolutely top notch.

            If you want something like ice cream, but a bit lighter than ice cream, check out the gelato here! I got a triple scoop of Strawberry, Vanilla Bean, and Green Tea in a cup. I thought that after spending the day eating BBQ Pork Buns all around SF, I would regret this decision -- but I was wrong! The gelato was light and refreshing, and true to each of its flavors. I was particularly happy that the green tea wasn&#39;t bitter!My friend got a scoop of Sesame on a cone and said it was deliciously rich and just intense enough. Another friend got the Guava and Lychee. She particularly enjoyed the Lychee, which had little bits of lychee in it!

            The Popcorn Chicken here gets you a large serving of beautifully seasoned, melt-in-your-mouth chicken. If you need more of a kick, add some pepper salt and chili powder. Grab a bubble tea next door, sit down, and enjoy some great chicken!The other items we got here couldn&#39;t compare to the Popcorn Chicken. The Gyoza had super thick skin, which seemed untraditional to me; I ate a few, but couldn&#39;t decide whether I liked it or not. The Takoyaki was tasty and had a mayonnaise-like sauce covering it. The Sweet Potato Fries were plentiful and long, but not crispy enough for me.

            This is it! After visiting several bakeries in SF during a BBQ Pork Bun Crawl, Victor&#39;s Bakery emerged as the unanimous champion!This bun has the perfect amount of fluffy bread -- just enough to give you that softness you love, yet has enough room to allow for a generous serving of delicious, chunky meat. The subtle sauce coating the meat made this bun a real winner. We also had Hong Kong Milk Tea, which is like traditional milk tea, but made much heavier with lots of condensed milk. Served hot, this tea can complement any of the baked goods you can get here.This bakery also has Portuguese Custard Cups! Unfortunately, they sell out rather quickly -- the custard cups come out at 9:30 AM and are sold out by noon -- so come in early if you want to try them!This visit was part of a 6-person BBQ Pork Bun Crawl to a bunch of San Francisco&#39;s most popular bakeries.

            The Steamed Pork Bun here features untraditional brownish bread, that looked like it was made with whole wheat. This departure from tradition for the bread, and the average tasting meat within, made for an unimpressive experience. That said, the other items we tried here were much better. The Savory Pork and Vegetable Buns provided a great combination of flavors, and the dim sum items we tried -- the Chive Dumpling and Bean Curd in Tofu Wrap -- were also great and definitely worth checking out.This visit was part of a 6-person BBQ Pork Bun Crawl to a bunch of San Francisco&#39;s most popular bakeries.

            It&#39;s hard to find a place that you can just walk into and get steamed pork buns. They are traditionally served at sit-down dim sum places. But not only does Good Mong Kok -- a walk in, order, walk out bakery -- have them, they&#39;re also amazing. Good Mong Kok has both Steamed and Baked BBQ Pork Buns, which come packed with tons of great-tasting meat in wonderfully soft bread. My pork-bun-hunting-party enjoyed their BBQ Pork Buns so much we even got one of their Savory Pork and Vegetable Buns, which was also incredibly delicious!If I lived near Good Mong Kok, I would DEFINITELY, GUARANTEED get a Steamed Pork Bun every single day for the rest of my life.

            We got the Baked BBQ Pork Bun: a flat, sweet, chewy bun filled with sweet meat in a thick, glutinous sauce. A good balance of the salty and sweet ingredients made for a well-flavored bun. One complaint among our group was about the parchment paper that the bun was baked on; it was quite difficult to remove, and when removed, took a layer of the bun with it!This visit was part of a 6-person BBQ Pork Bun Crawl to a bunch of San Francisco&#39;s most popular bakeries.

            Amber India has helped me realize a sad truth: life is too short and you only have one stomach to fill. I love so many dishes here that my biggest problem is not stuffing myself!The Butter Chicken, made with shredded chicken in a savory sauce made with tomatoes and butter, is rich and delicious! I jokingly tell people it&#39;s called Butter Chicken because there is no way they can make it taste so good without mixing in an entire stick of butter! Compared to the Butter Chicken, the Chicken Tikka Masala has larger chunks of chicken in a lighter masala sauce.While I&#39;m a big fan of their main chicken dishes, their vegetarian entr√©es shine as well. My favorite is the Navratan Korma, which features mixed vegetables and nuts cooked in a thick, creamy white sauce. The deep fried potato and cheese dumplings in tomato sauce -- the Malai Kofta -- is another great dish, although I wish each order contained more dumplings. The Kadhai Paneer -- which features cottage cheese, bell peppers, and onions cooked in a light tomato sauce -- is another personal favorite.The staff here is incredibly kind and helpful. I&#39;ve called in large orders for lunches at my company -- an hour before lunch. The great team at Amber has never failed to magically prepare a feast for 40 people in a shockingly short amount of time.Given how many dishes I love here, the buffet is the most economical way to have a little bit of everything. It&#39;s always a little heartbreaking when I want just one more bite, but I realize that my body can&#39;t handle it... C&#39;est la vie...

            I am no wine aficionado, but I love the wine tastings at Grgich. Anytime I bring friends and family to Napa, Grgich is always on our itinerary, because every visit there so far has been great.The staff at Grgich is awesome. Other wine tastings I&#39;ve done have a server or two serving an entire hall of people, seemingly racing to get everyone to the last glass of wine and out the door. At Grgich, you&#39;ll be in groups of six to eight at most with a server who pours and talks you throughout the tasting. The servers are personable and are always eager to answer my questions. Linda is a shining example of Grgich&#39;s awesomeness. On my latest visit, when my group told her they loved the &#39;09 Cabernet Sauvignon, Linda grabbed an &#39;06 bottle for us to compare it with. The founder, Mike Grgich, who just celebrated his 90th birthday and still actively participates in winemaking, showed up during one wine tasting. This is the same guy who made a Chardonnay that won the Paris Wine Tasting of 1976, absolutely shocking the entire industry. Like a true European (he&#39;s Croatian), he paid special attention to the girls in our party.You can google for a 2-for-1 coupon for the wine tasting to save some money. You&#39;ll get to taste 5 different wines (whites and reds), hear all about winemaking, and you even get to keep your glass. Through all my visits to Grgich, I&#39;ve already amassed a nice collection of wine glasses!

            This place has 60 lanes so when a group of us came in on a Saturday afternoon, we didn&#39;t have to wait at all. That said, we bowled from 4 PM to 8 PM, and the place never got that busy.You can pay per person per game (between $5 and $6), or reserve a lane for an hour (between $24 and $27). With 5 of us, we were able to get 2 and a half games in, so the hourly rate was a much better deal: $27 vs ~$70.The gentleman at the front desk was helpful. When we told him another group of people were coming to join us, he reserved the lane next to ours. Later on when our lane suffered some technical issues, we asked for a few more minutes to be added to our game time, and he happily obliged.

            Ayola is Smule&#39;s go-to restaurant when we crave Mediterranean food. Ayola has consistently and punctually delivered great food to our office to feed 40+ hungry people.Their menu is filled with awesome pita sandwiches, salads, and various sides. I love their Troy Salad (gyros meat on a Greek salad). It comes with tons of long, thin strips of gyros meat that pack a ton of flavor. Even though the meat can be drier than usual gyros meat, I actually don&#39;t mind that; I eagerly devour the salad, usually with a side order of hummus.For very large orders, we place them the evening before the meal. The delivery guy is super friendly and even helps unpack and lay out our order on the table. Our orders cover their entire menu (it&#39;s all so good), and there are never any leftovers!

            When I had to pick up 40 copies of StarCraft 2: Heart of the Swarm for StarCraft 2 Day at Smule, I came to this GameStop to pre-order the copies. The incredibly friendly and talkative store manager, Roger, helped me out. You might think he&#39;s being friendly because I was making a rather large purchase, but no; he shared his bottomless enthusiasm with all the other customers in the store.This store opens at 11 AM, so I asked Roger if there was any way to pick up the copies earlier. He told me to pass by around 10 AM, and he&#39;d be in early to give me the copies. Everything went according to plan, and Roger even threw in a huge StarCraft 2 promotional stand-up display! Thanks, Roger!

            This restaurant, as well as the parking lot, was packed when we stopped by on a Saturday night. The friendly staff was able to quickly take orders and get our food out ridiculously fast. As I&#39;ve come to expect at every In-N-Out, the Double-Double and Fries prepared a la Animal Style were delicious!Seating inside can seat up to 4 in booths. Outside, there are a few tables that can cozily seat 8 people!And if a meal at In-N-Out doesn&#39;t fill you up, you can always stroll over to the Krispy Kreme next door. Given their proximity, an In-N-Out burger with a Krispy Kreme donut bun mash-up might be worth exploring!

            Wow! This gem in the heart of downtown Napa provides an amazing meal, from the first bite to the last.My cousin and I shared a Salmon Ceviche Tostadas appetizer. The citric acid in ceviche denatures the salmon, giving it the appearance of being cooked -- but this salmon was so tender, I swear they must&#39;ve cheated and cooked (and then chilled) the salmon! My cousin got the Skirt Steak Tacos, which were meaty and succulent, and -- surprisingly for a taco -- not a wet, sloppy mess of ingredients. I love sandwiches, so I went with the La Cubana Torta Plate which contains carnitas (pulled pork), ham, peruvian beans, swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard with a side of perfectly seasoned and spicy fries. This... This plate... Wow! With every bite of this masterpiece, the mixture of flavors blended in my mouth in perfect harmony! Each bite provided a chance to focus on a different piece of the torta.At this point, we were so completely satisfied with our meal that we were surprised when the server brought out the churros we&#39;d ordered, but had forgotten about! These freshly made churros were very, very crispy on the outside, but SO soft on the inside. If I had a glass of warm soymilk with these churros, I&#39;d definitely require a nap before leaving!

            This restaurant provides great bang-for-your-buck. I met a friend here for lunch. We shared an appetizer of minty fresh Spring Rolls with pork and shrimp wrapped in a soft vermicelli wrap. For the main course, we shared a Lemongrass Pork Shoulder Rice Plate and a Lemongrass Tofu Rice Plate. While I&#39;m a huge fan of anything with pork, the Lemongrass Tofu dish with perfectly seasoned and crispy tofu absolutely blew me away! We also got a side of Grilled Eggplant with Garlic-Chili Fish Sauce, which was a surprising highlight of our meal. With tea for each of us, the entire meal cost $40 with tip. The decor and atmosphere of the restaurant give it an upscale feel. You&#39;ll get great food and service, all for a great price!

            2011 was a rough year for my car.In July, my rear passenger window was broken into. I called Safelite the next morning and got an appointment for that afternoon. I dropped my car off and hung out for an hour while they cleaned up the shards of glass and replaced my window.Something went wrong during installation and the auto-up feature stopped working. The technician told me to get it fixed at a dealership, and then call Safelite to get reimbursed. I was a little suspicious since he made it sound like the reimbursement process was painless. Turns out, he was right! I called Safelite after getting it fixed and spoke with someone super helpful and courteous. After faxing them the receipt, I had a check a few weeks later.In October, a rock kicked up by a vehicle in front of me left a crack in my windshield. The next day I was at Safelite and my windshield was quickly patched up. The technician warned me that they can&#39;t make the crack completely disappear, but they can fill it in and prevent it from cracking more. The damage is now barely noticeable and the crack has not grown. You&#39;ll never be happy because going to Safelite means something has already gone wrong, but they resolved my problems in a reasonable manner.

            Finger lickin&#39; good barbecue that delivers? Yes please!From their barbecue menu, my absolute favorite item is the always tender Beef Brisket. I also really like the succulent Jamaican Jerked Chicken as well as the St. Louis-Cut Spare Ribs, which are drenched in a not-too-spicy hot sauce.That said, I&#39;m a not a huge fan of BBQ, but their sides are amazing; I wouldn&#39;t mind just eating from their sides menu for a meal. My favorite is the BBQ baked beans: ridiculously large beans from the Iacopi Farm in Half Moon Bay with chunks of brisket, simmered in a smoky sauce. The Pull-Apart Potato Rolls are also delicious, especially when dunked in the butter sauce that comes with the Grilled Asparagus. The Cheezy Grits are great and the Potlikker Collard Greens once again proves that bacon can make anything delicious.Like other SF restaurants that deliver, they use bike couriers, but they pack their items in sturdy plastic containers. This keeps your food safe as it tumbles around in the courier&#39;s backpack.

            I didn&#39;t want a cone or waffle bowl to interfere with my ice cream so I went with a triple scoop of Strawberry, French Custard Vanilla, and Banana in a cup. Every flavor was rich and true to its name. Of these three, I enjoyed Strawberry and Banana the most. My sister got a sugar cone with Toasted Almond and Claire&#39;s Pie (coffee ice cream with fudge, almonds, chocolate chips, and graham crunch pieces) and thoroughly enjoyed it. My cousin got a waffle cone with White Pistachio and Toasted Almond. A fan of pistachios, she felt the ice cream did pistachios justice!We heard a lot of good things about the Ube (purple yam) flavor so we got a single scoop. The taste of their Ube is subtle and can be overpowered by stronger flavors, so cleanse your palate before diving into this unique flavor. They use a deli-style waiting system: you grab a numbered ticket when you come in and are served when your number is called. Even if you come in close to closing time, as long as you grab a ticket, you will be served -- so don&#39;t fret!My first taste of Mitchell&#39;s was very enjoyable, and I&#39;m looking forward to returning to explore more of the 40+ flavors they offer.

            One of our engineers, Steve, relocated to North Carolina, but still visits every so often, so we can &#34;talk about serious engineering business.&#34; But the real reason behind his visits is the best pastrami place ever: The Refuge!Come with a voracious appetite because you&#39;re going to want to eat appetizers, a hearty entr√©e, and dessert! My favorite appetizer is the Goofy Fries: soft garlic fries covered in melted cheddar and chunks of pastrami. The Gratineed Macaroni &amp; Cheese is good, but I&#39;ve had better at other places. If you want to explore the hidden side of The Refuge, order the PASTRAMI STEAK from the SECRET MENU! Instead of getting your delicious pastrami chopped up in a sandwich, you&#39;ll enjoy a ridiculously large slab of pastrami so tender you can cut it with your fork. I always go with the Swiss &amp; Mustard, which features huge chunks of pastrami, swiss, and mustard on toasted rye. If you like all that AND like sauerkraut, go with the popular Reuben. They also have ribeye cheesesteaks and burgers, supposedly... But I can&#39;t stop eating the pastrami, so I can&#39;t honestly say!The climax of your meal approaches: dessert. Order the Superlative Bread Pudding. It&#39;s so hard to put into words how delicious it is. The outside is perfectly crispy and the inside so sweet and soft, resulting in a gastronomic nirvana! The serving is large and you&#39;ll likely be stuffed by this point. So remember, boys and girls, this gift from the Gods should be shared with friends.

            This place rocks! Arrive with an appetite -- as you cannot prepare yourself for the amount of food you will consume!We usually go with the half spicy, half original broth base; both are absolutely delicious. The broth here is really standout.The prime rib and Shiitake mushrooms are my favorite items from the meat and vegetable family. Aside from all the meat and vegetables you get to throw into your hot pot, I love the Mongolian beef pie. A pancake filled with ground beef pan-fried to absolute perfection, I might blasphemously believe this is the best thing on their entire menu. These also keep really well in the fridge and can be reheated in a toaster oven to near out-of-the-kitchen freshness.If you somehow have room in your stomach for dessert, their dessert items are pretty good! My favorite is the Phoenix Egg Yolk Bun (Lai Wong Bao): a egg yolk wrapped in a soft steamed bun.The staff is super friendly and down to earth. One time, my friend got pretty drunk, began claiming he was the most sober member of our group, and started walking around the restaurant looking for the restroom and eventually stumbled into the kitchen. The people in the back and the waiters laughed it off and sent him back to us. A few weeks later, I came in and our waiter from that night asked if my &#34;super sober friend&#34; was coming!

            Don&#39;t just take my word for it -- the entire Smule office loves Jin Sho! When we vote Jin Sho for dinner, it seems everyone suddenly becomes more inclined to stick around and work late!The rolls here cover a wide gamut from quirky and fried to more traditional rolls. While their traditional rolls are great, I&#39;m a sucker for their more unique rolls. The Volcano Roll is a spicy tuna roll covered with salmon and spicy mayo, baked to perfection. The Sharks Roll is a spicy deep-fried roll that reminds me of my favorite comfort sushi restaurant: Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose. The Imperial Roll is a tangy fried roll with a bread crumb nori wrap. The Stanford Roll (you might&#39;ve heard of this university) is an eel/avocado roll covered with spicy tuna. There is never much room left after I go through all of my favorite rolls, but coworkers who order entr√©es -- like the black cod -- always sing its high praises. My friend who is a lot better than me at discerning freshness always looks forward to their uni and sashimi.The chefs and staff are both extremely friendly. I got to know them well since I came in often to grab Smule&#39;s large dinner orders. At some point, I crossed &#34;that threshold&#34; and the chefs began offering me these unique, off-the-menu, complimentary hand rolls whenever I rolled in. When word of these legendary hand rolls spread, I got a lot more offers to help pick up the sushi!

            This is my go-to Chinese spot when I&#39;m down in Palo Alto.The lady who takes your order over the phone is hilarious. As she takes your order, she&#39;ll yell out the items in Chinese to the chef. This was a bit disconcerting at first because I thought she was yelling at me for ordering something wrong, but I quickly got used to the ad-hoc three-person conversation. Whenever I finished ordering, she always kindly recommended (pushed) another item or two to make sure I had the Chinese take-out food groups -- meat, fish, rice, and veggies -- covered.The menu is huge. While I try to avoid ordering like an American at Chinese restaurants, I can&#39;t help myself at Da Sichuan because the &#34;American Chinese&#34; dishes are so good. I also might not be able handle their more authentic dishes because they are so mind numbingly spicy. The General&#39;s Chicken is covered in chilis and a reddish-brown sauce, which pack a small kick. The Walnut Prawns are fantastically fried and covered in an addictive, sweet mayonnaise. The potstickers are great: thick-skinned and bursting with tasty broth. So be careful not to burn yourself when eating them! My one complaint: the Mongolian Beef dish should be called Mongolian Onions since you get so many onions and so little beef. I&#39;ve ordered this a few times and gotten the same beef-to-onion ratio so I&#39;m suspecting the beef is there to merely season the onions! Smule&#39;s co-founder, Ge Wang, is a huge fan of this place. When he calls Da Sichuan, instead of saying hello, all he says is, &#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; and they know exactly who it is. Also, Ge told me the name of the chef translated to English is Jackie Chan. I&#39;m still not quite sure if he&#39;s trolling me...

            The Smule team totally loves Anatolian Kitchen. Between November 2011 when we first discovered this restaurant to the twilight of our Palo Alto office in April 2013, we placed over 60 take-out orders with 0 unhappy Smuleans! Yep - we ate from this fine place about once a week and no one ever complained!Their menu features so many great dishes that you&#39;ll have to visit several times before you even cover my favorites. Iskender&#39;s Favorite is a delicious entree consisting of lamb and beef in a buttery tomato sauce blend and a side of thick, creamy yogurt. This entree is very heavy, so you might want to share it with a dining partner! Going a bit lighter, the Moussaka Plate is a perfect confection of eggplant, lamb, beef, potato, and veggies covered in a delicious homemade tomato sauce. If you want to sample all the meats this place offers, check out the Combo Grill Plate; or if you&#39;re in the mood for fish, the perfectly tender salmon in the Grilled Salmon plate never disappoints.The meals always arrived in a very reasonable amount of time, and Don, their delivery guy, is really nice and funny. The Smule team now works out of a San Francisco office. When dinnertime rolls around I know there are many Smuleans wishing Anatolian Kitchen would deliver to our SF office!

            When I needed a large poster printed for a conference, I called the local shops in SoMa to get estimates. Since they were all in the same range, I went with the one closest to Smule&#39;s office: Speedway.The staff member seemed to have a lot of questions about how I wanted the poster printed, but I just told her to make the poster look super awesome, and I knew she understood what I needed. I had a feeling walking out of the store that she wasn&#39;t going to disappoint. The next day, my expectation panned out and I walked out a happy customer with a gorgeous poster. I will definitely come back here if I ever need anything professionally printed.

            Although french fries are Belgian in origin, this casual French restaurant makes some amazing french fries. Pay the extra buck for the truffle oil and prepare yourself for perfectly crispy fries that are absolutely addictive; I wanted to stop eating them, but couldn&#39;t help myself! My dining partner and I shared an Assiette Chasseur plate which came with a large slab of p√¢t√©, mustard, and pieces of baguette. The p√¢t√© was great although more bread would&#39;ve been nice, since we weren&#39;t even halfway through the p√¢t√© when it ran out. Afterwards, I had the delicious Quiche Lorraine (bacon, onions, Gruy√®re) which had a crisp, yet soft crust. ¬†My dining partner got the daily special: the French burger with brie, which came with three large, gooey slices of brie. Sometimes burgers taste like an incongruous mixture of the drier and wetter ingredients, but every piece of this burger from bread to patty came together to create a perfectly juicy confection.The desserts were good, but didn&#39;t blow us away. The molten chocolate cake was a chocolate cake with melted chocolate on top. It did come with a homemade whipped cream made with nutmeg, which was actually quite refreshing. But the cake was nothing special. I had the cr√®me brul√©e, which was passable.We had a great time and I&#39;m looking forward to trying the spicy lamb sausage sandwich on our next visit!

            Sure, it&#39;s pretty expensive, but Equinox is a great gym and you&#39;re paying for what you get. The gym is super clean and has everything I need for my lifting, as well as plenty of cardio machines. Very rarely have I ever had to wait to use anything in the gym. There are plenty of complimentary classes, but I&#39;ve only done the Vinyasa Yoga, which I enjoyed. There is also a pool on the roof that I&#39;ve used a few times before accepting the fact that I&#39;m a terribly inefficient swimmer. I could pay a trainer a lot of money to make me more efficient, but... it&#39;s a lot of money.It&#39;s the little things that really make Equinox worth it for me. The chilled Eucalyptus towels sound absolutely unnecessary but are incredibly refreshing if you&#39;re working hard. The endless supply of Kheil&#39;s shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion leave me feeling SO SMOOTH after a workout. The complementary razors in the shower room have helped me keep my abnormally large head bald and shiny for months.All staff members, from the greeter at the front desk to the staff who keep the place spotless, are extremely friendly and personable. If you&#39;re thinking about Equinox, come check it out. If the price tag scares you, try looking at it as a commitment device. You&#39;ll certainly be pushing yourself to get the most out of that extravagant monthly membership fee!

            Growing up in Newark I took for granted how easy it was to find great custard cups and Portuguese rolls. Now living in California, I always look forward to visiting my family in NJ, both to see them and of course enjoy some deliciously authentic baked goods from Teixeira&#39;s Bakery!The custard cups are absolutely perfect. My college friends always looked forward to visits from my family because that meant delicious custard cups were also coming. When my roommate TJ heard they were coming &#34;Oh god...&#34; was all he could mutter. When my parents moved out of Newark, they even got our American neighbors hooked on custard cups; our neighbors&#39; toddlers also look forward to my visits because there are guaranteed custard cup deliveries!I love bread, but Portuguese rolls are one-of-a-kind. I grew up on sloppy joes prepared on Portuguese rolls; they were the backbone of my lunch through most of elementary school! A toasted, buttered Portuguese roll with a glass of soymilk is my go-to breakfast when I visit home. Really, anything on a Portuguese roll transforms into something infinitely better. Growing up, whatever we had for dinner would quickly be put into a Portuguese roll and it always resulted in a delicious sandwich!My parents don&#39;t live in Newark anymore, but fortunately both of these Portuguese staples can be stored for up to a week. Throw the custard cups in the fridge and freeze and the bread, and you&#39;ll never be without these gifts from the culinary gods.

            My long, arduous journey to find the perfect backpack eventually brought me to the Tumi Store near Union Square. I saw some backpacks on their website that interested me, but wanted to come check them out in person.Every staff member was really friendly and enthusiastic, answering all questions I had.When I saw a bag I liked but not in the preferred color, they called their sister store at the Westfield Mall and confirmed that the bag was in stock there. As I thanked them and was about to leave, one of the employees told me there was going to be a huge sale starting the next day and that I should go to their sister store and do a &#34;pre-sale&#34; on the bag to reserve it. Thanks to him, I saved a boatload on my bag purchases.I ended up going with an anthracite Alpha Bravo Travis Backpack which I absolutely love. The backpack is stylish, sturdy, has tons of compartments, and has already survived a trip to Korea! Tumi bags are pricey, but I&#39;m hoping to get a lot of mileage out of this stylish bag!

            Their egg tarts are definitely the freshest I have ever had. Tasted like the Chinese lady dropped them straight from the oven into my bag! That said, growing up in a Portuguese family, I went through boxes and boxes of delicious past√©is de nata (Portuguese custard cups) so I&#39;m partial to that style, and am actually not a huge fan of Chinese style egg tarts. My favorite item from my first trip here was the beef curry pie - a savory empanada filled with a spicy beef curry. Their cream bread disappointed me a bit, but that may be because I have recently enjoyed awesome cream bread at bakeries in Seoul. The bread&#39;s outer shell was a bit too rubbery in texture and the cream inside was not anything special.The lines get long here, but the workers are not only efficient at fulfilling orders, but also really friendly. This place is also cash-only so don&#39;t waste your time standing in line if you don&#39;t have cash!I love steamed pork buns and was looking forward to giving theirs a try. Unfortunately they were totally out and I didn&#39;t want to wait 20 minutes for the next batch. I&#39;m definitely coming back to see if I can grab some delicious meat-filled buns!

            This place takes your childhood grilled cheese and ups the ante many-many-many-manyfold. My favorite sandwich is the Jalape√±o Popper featuring ch√®vre, Monterey jack, apricot-jalape√±o relish, and applewood-smoked bacon. Every bite is an excellent mix of cheesy goodness, perfectly crispy bacon, and a little kick from the jalape√±os. I usually get this as part of the The Red, White and Blue Plate Special which gives you a slightly smaller sandwich with a soup or salad. Their smoky tomato soup has been a hit-or-miss for me as sometimes it just seems too watered down. They also serve breakfast sandwiches until 11 AM on weekdays. The Smule team absolutely loves them. My favorite is the Breakfast Piglet which features sharp cheddar, ham, apple mustard, and rosemary butter on delicious levain bread. And just when you thought these guys were a one-trick-grilled-cheese-sandwich pony, you realize they also do baked goods amazingly well. Their muffins, especially the berry-infused ones, are great. My favorite is the blueberry and raspberry muffin, which is filled with whole berries. They bake them in the morning, but sometimes they have some left over that you can grab at lunchtime.During lunch, the line extends out the door so avoid coming at exactly noon if you are in a rush. They have seating inside and outside. Although all the seating might be taken as you arrive, something usually frees up while you are waiting for your food to come out.

            Oh my, this place is absolutely amazing! If you&#39;re a sushi purist (snob) or want a traditional sushi experience, this probably isn&#39;t the place for you. But if you want a unique melt-in-your-mouth experience, Cha Cha is the place for you!Their special rolls prove that you can&#39;t go wrong if you go big with your rolls and add in some frying and baking. Take my personal favorite, the Alaskan Crispy, a deep fried salmon and cream cheese roll topped with wasabi mayo, unagi sauce and tobiko. As a piece melts in my mouth, my arteries cry out in pain as they are slowly clogged with a rich mixture of cream cheese and salmon. Worth it! I really enjoy their baked rolls which both start out life as a simple California Roll: the Lion King adds tender baked salmon, and the Ocean Side adds succulent baked scallops. Even rolls that I did not particularly fall in love with, like the spicy tuna-based Sparky, are delicious. The Sparky actually ranked very highly with my dining partners and I totally did not regret having three pieces of it! On my most recent visit, we gave the dessert menu a try and just when I was convinced Cha Cha could only provide an amazing experience via their sushi rolls, I was proven wrong. The vanilla tempura ice cream, covered in a thick pie-like crust with a dollop of whipped cream was absolutely delicious. The tempura ice cream can also comfortably feed four as it is a nicely sized breaded ball cut into four pieces. The menu should aptly rename the green tea ice cream to Goblet of Green Tea Ice Cream as it was served in a giant goblet and fed four of us with some left to spare. The mochi ice cream (one order cut into four pieces) is also above average. Do note that they drizzle chocolate sauce on all their dessert items. We have had some waiters ask and some not, but if you&#39;re not a fan of chocolate like me or don&#39;t want chocolate distracting your taste buds, just ask for them to not put chocolate on your dessert items!They are wildly popular and busy, and they don&#39;t take reservations -- so expect a bit of a wait even if you come on a weekday. Two people can usually get seated within 15 minutes, especially if you don&#39;t mind sitting at the sushi bar. I have found coming with four people is the way to go for maximizing the amount of rolls you get to try as most rolls come cut into eight pieces. Expect a slightly longer wait if your party is larger, especially if you want a table. That said, whether we have had to wait 30 minutes or an hour, once we&#39;re seated and eating no one seems to mention the wait ever again!The restaurant is clean, well-maintained and the service is great. The rolls come out ridiculously fast even when the place is packed -- so if you had to wait a while to be seated, do not fret as your wait will be quickly rewarded. The complimentary spicy mussels and green tea add a nice touch to an already amazing and ridiculously economical experience. Rolls range in price but average around $10 per roll. If you love your friends and family, bring them here. You owe it to them. And for being such a good person, you will be rewarded as well!

            After I told a coworker about my new addiction to dumplings and dim sum, she recommended I come check this place out. Some people might be put off by how close in name this restaurant is to a Chinese fast food chain, but don&#39;t let that turn you off! I stopped by for lunch with some friends and we fell in love during our first visit and try to stop by here at least once a month to get some tasty dumplings and dim sum.If you&#39;re getting dumplings, go with the freshly handmade crab/pork soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) and skip over their other dumplings that are frozen. The soup dumplings are absolutely delicious. They come out piping hot, so give it a minute, then get the dumpling in your mouth, close your eyes, and prepare to bite down and release an amazing mixture of broth, pork, and crab! Yum!Some of my other favorite items on the menu include their tasty chive pancakes which are empanada-like in structure. Lightly fried to perfection, they&#39;re filled with scrambled egg, chives, and rice noodle. You basically get two &#34;empanadas&#34; cut in half so this can comfortably feed four. Their pork buns are savory and are not filled with the traditional sweet pork you normally get in steamed buns, but they are great nonetheless. Their spicy wontons are also great - actually pretty spicy and drenched in a thick peanut sauce.They also do entree dishes, but we haven&#39;t explored that side of the menu very thoroughly though we did get an eggplant entree once which we both enjoyed!The decor isn&#39;t anything to brag about but the restaurant is clean and the staff has always been friendly and attentive during our many visits.The absolute worst part about eating here is we have both honed in on our absolutely favorite items leaving very little room to experiment. Fortunately, we&#39;ve realized that bringing along family and friends gives us more mouths to feed and more opportunity to explore their menu!
