Huge kudos to them!The event was pretty low-key as there were only a handful of Yelpers around. It was nice to be able to chat in a quiet place with a small group of people. Naturally, we talked at length about our favorite places of eat; our bookmark lists grew quite a bit!The massage itself was great. My masseuse, Daisy, really put on a good amount of pressure when I asked her to really dig in. The team at Elements Massage were all kind and friendly. The premises were clean and well-maintained. If you&#39;re in downtown San Mateo and looking for a massage before eating some delicious food, check out Elements!"

Everything about my first visit was beyond my expectations for an unassuming sandwich shop.They have FORTY signature sandwiches all at an extremely affordable price range (under 9 dollars)! Some are pretty standard like the #2 - Smokin&#39; Sequoia with turkey, bacon, cheddar, and avocado. Others are wild like #30 - Burn in Heaven which is a meatball sandwich with jalapeños and Lava and Bomb sauce!The bread is freshly made. If you&#39;re asked if you mind waiting a few extra minutes for fresh-out-of-the-oven bread, the right answer is, &#34;Of course I don&#39;t mind waiting for delicious fresh bread! Do you take me for a mad person!?&#34;Pro tip! Bring a friend and get two sandwiches you&#39;re both into. Split the sandwiches and you&#39;ll get to sample two different bites of sandwich heaven. Don&#39;t forget: friends who eat delicious sandwiches together, stay together!During my first visit for lunch I had the Burn in Heaven and Hangover. Both we&#39;re absolutely on point! Not going to lie, I almost came back the same day for dinner. It was THAT good!"

The Instagrammablewich is sure to get you some likes on a popular social photo sharing network! My go-to is the simple Ham, Egg and Cheese breakfast sandwich with a side of tater tots. It looks pretty unassuming but it packs a lot of flavor and more than satisfies my morning hunger. And you can&#39;t forget the donuts! They have a nice variety - anyone in the mood for a Maple Bacon Bar? I highly recommend trying the Apple Fritter.

You can get an entree-worth of gnocchi but it is pretty heavy so we opted for the appetizer-sized version.Bread basket was on point. Yes - you can do a bread basket wrong! And Stella did it right. The bread was warm and the butter was not rock hard. It&#39;s easy to overlook these things so it&#39;s nice to see them get it right. Our entrees were good. The Rigatoni al Ragu di Maiale came with a very generous amount of smoked pork. The Scottadito di Agnello (lamb chops) were also good.We ended our meal with a Bread Pudding del Giorno. It was definitely a unique take on bread pudding. The pudding was covered in coconut flakes and served with a hot pineapple cream.All in all Stella provides a great ambiance, amazing gnocchi, good food, and - most importantly to a bread lover - warm bread and butter!"

To name a few that come to mind: seafood, barbecue, pizza, burgers, soup, tacos, cheese and meat, sushi, chinese dim sum, gelato, egg tarts.It&#39;s a buffet, but all the items were definitely above the typical mediocre buffet quality you expect at buffets."

We were definitely not prepared for the amount of food, but thoroughly devoured and enjoyed everything that came our way. It&#39;s pricey and it probably will be even more expensive during my next visit. Prices are probably going up as often as rent is in San Francisco. Every price label seems to have been changed 4-5 times given the stack of small white labels displaying the price. Pro tip - if you really enjoy any of the Banchan dishes, don&#39;t hesitate to ask for some more."

Also, looking on the positive side, Luke&#39;s leaves plenty of room for some delicious cookies from Levain Bakery which is only a quick walk away!From the name to Noah&#39;s Ark, there are a lot of biblical references being thrown around and I think that&#39;s for a good reason.

If you want to take the challenge be sure to call in the day before to reserve a big donut because they sell out fast! I failed the challenge, but still enjoyed the rest of the large donut, AND a Buttermilk Maple Donut afterwards!"

But I wasn&#39;t so divinely inspired during my meal. Oh wells..."

The Mango flavor tasted like they froze a Mango Lassi. The Apple Custard Pie flavor was pretty good too. I definitely need to come here again because I only covered a small portion of their flavors."

He even split up items like the soup so we could both gluttonously dive in without worrying about our dining partner&#39;s share.We thoroughly enjoyed everything we ordered: Warm Deviled Eggs, Baked Oysters, Roasted Bone Marrow, and the Marlowe Burger. The Marlowe Burger deserves a special shout-out for being one of the most amazing burgers I&#39;ve ever had. And it was also cooked exactly as I requested. It&#39;s really amazing biting into a burger cooked rare! So, so, so juicy! Dessert impressed as well. The Upside Down Strawberry Crisp and the TCHO Chocolate Cream Pie closed out a wonderful meal. My dining partner and I were sitting at the end of the bar. A friend joined us halfway through our meal. I was worried we were going to get hassled for blocking the passage between the dining hall and the kitchen. Instead, we found the staff offering us another stool for the friend to sit next to us."

Here are some highlights: - Baked BBQ Pork Bun - In my humble opinion, the true test of a Chinese bakery. The ones at Sheng Kee are good: soft bread, lots of juicy meat, and large. I ate three in one day and that made my day pretty awesome.- Portuguese Custard Tart - I grew up eating the best Portuguese Custard Cups in the world at Teixeira&#39;s Bakery in Newark, NJ. The ones at Sheng Kee are good, but I wouldn&#39;t cry tears of joy at the sight of them. Yes, I&#39;m a snob. Yes, I&#39;m Portuguese. So take my word for it.- Cream Cheese Toast - I love cream cheese, so I bought some sliced cream cheese toast bread. The cream cheese isn&#39;t evenly spread throughout the entire loaf, so some bites are awesome, but most are just average.- Blueberry Cream Cheese Pastry - Awesome! Soft, flaky crust filled with a good amount of blueberry jam and cream cheese."

Tonpei Yaki - An omelette with pork, cabbage, and topped with mustard and mayonnaise? YES, PLEASE. Really delicious dish!Deep-Fried Swimming Crab Legs - Gah! I was hoping this dish didn&#39;t come with the shell still on the crab legs because I hate working for my food. Even though the shell was soft enough after frying to just eat, I wasn&#39;t feeling it. Fortunately, my dining partner is a hard-working eater and took care of all the legs."

And I didn&#39;t mind at all!Special California Roll (real crab, avocado) - A California Roll with REAL crab. The real, shredded crab gives this roll a unique texture, but aside from that it&#39;s just the Plain Jane of sushi rolls. Overall, the roll could do with a little more crab. T.N.T. Roll (spicy tuna, cream cheese, jalapeño, deep fried) - PARTY&#39;S HERE! One DAMN GOOD deep-fried roll that was on par with what I expect of Cha Cha!Volcano Roll (spicy scallop, with more scallop) - I was expecting something cooked, but what we got was a mountain of scallop (the volcano) surrounded by a simple fresh roll with some spicy red sauce. It wasn&#39;t bad, but definitely didn&#39;t blow me away.Lion King (crab meat, avocado, baked salmon, tobiko, spicy mayo sauce) - This roll just melts in your mouth. Comparable with Cha Cha&#39;s except you get less baked salmon on top; I wouldn&#39;t mind paying for more salmon to do this roll some TRUE JUSTICE.Mochi Ice Cream - We got all four flavors they had that evening: Chocolate, Green Tea, Strawberry, and Mango. My favorite was Strawberry, hers was Chocolate. Neither of us cared much for the Green Tea which, oddly enough, tasted kind of soapy. Green Tea Ice Cream - Unlike the Green Tea Mochi Ice Cream, this ice cream was a much better at executing on its green tea flavor. Not too sweet and a bit bitter, but that&#39;s what you expect of Green Tea Ice Cream.In short - I&#39;ll be back and I&#39;m going to focus on their cooked and fried rolls because there&#39;s a lot of potential for an amazing meal here."

This shop was established because the owner&#39;s son is super sensitive to gluten and he wanted a place where his son could eat without worrying. Not sure if he wants his son to live in a world where there is a 25% fee for having an allergy.- No seating inside. They used to have it, but fire regulations did away with it.

My family digs their BBQ Chicken, Pork Cutlets, and BBQ Short Ribs. These all come with a side of yellow rice (with a few veggies here and there), and fries or beans. While everything mentioned above is awesome, my favorite dish is their Cheesesteak Sandwich. It&#39;s not Philly-style where the meat is minced into small pieces. Here, you&#39;ll get a thin, whole piece of steak that packs a lot of wonderful smoky BBQ flavor. The cheese, onions, peppers, and soft bread make every bite decadent. The only thing that could make this bad boy better is if they served it on a Portuguese Roll instead of the generic bun they use. Thanks, 28 BBQ, for delivering some DELICIOUS Portuguese food."

There&#39;s no way this Chinese joint can make those well.&#34; WRONG.&#34;This lo mein dish with pork looks kind of weird; it&#39;s probably not going to be very good. Let&#39;s test&#39;em.&#34; WRONG AGAIN.&#34;Wow this dish looks amazing. If it tastes amazing, I&#39;m definitely coming back every week for the rest of my life.&#34; YES, it&#39;s amazing. YES, I&#39;m coming back next week AGAIN AND FOREVER. I always roll in after 8 PM to avoid the crowds and the supposed bad service that everyone on Yelp QQs about. My homegirl Cindy always take good care of my entourage. Thank you, Cafe Salina. See you next week! FOREVER."

Picking which ice cream flavors I want is the most important decision I make each week; thanks for helping to make it easier! I ended up going with:1. Secret Breakfast (Bourbon and Corn Flakes) - The Bourbon is strong with this one. Also, because of alcohol&#39;s melting point, this flavor was pleasantly softer than the other flavors. At times, the taste was so strong I felt like I was eating solid Bourbon. My last bite also had one of those large fused chunks of Corn Flakes -- WINNING!2. Pumpkin 5 Spice - A pleasant blend of savory and sweet flavors of my favorite fruit.3. Harvey Milk and Honey Graham - This was my favorite flavor of the three. It tasted like a cup of milk with crushed graham crackers in it -- absolutely awesome. It took me back to my graham-cracker-crushing childhood days.Thank you, Humphry Slocombe.

The bread was like a cloud: soft, airy, and delicious. Some of the meat inside was chewy, while other pieces were crispy. This was definitely my favorite dish. Fried Shrimp Potstickers - 1/5 - Very sad excuse for potstickers. The skin was super thin and was already falling apart as the dish was brought to our table. The shrimp inside was uninspiring and didn&#39;t do this dish any favors.Fried Shishito Peppers - 2/5 - The peppers were too damn salty!Honey Apple Shrimp - 3/5 - Like Honey Walnut Shrimp sans walnut plus fried apple pieces: fried shrimp and apple lathered in a decadent mayo sauce. This dish could&#39;ve been awesome, but some pieces of shrimp still had the tail (while others didn&#39;t), which was pretty annoying. Also, I&#39;m not quite sure what all the hype is about the owner ordering for you.

House-Made Green Tea Creme Brûlée - Thick, creamy, and absolutely decadent. The green seared top made the dish look a bit unappetizing.

I really enjoyed their Lion King Roll (crab, avocado, wrapped in salmon and baked with special sauce). The roll had a little tangy kick towards the end of each bite that I couldn&#39;t really put my finger on, so I figured the special sauce was just doing its thing. On the other hand, the Godzilla Roll (fried yellowtail topped with sweet and spicy sauce) was totally disappointing. Some pieces of this roll had barely any fish in them. Dessert was again a mixed bag. The Green Tea Cheese Cake should actually be called Green Tea Ice Cream Shaped Like a Cake. It looked like what I&#39;d imagine green tea cheese cake looks like, but it was FROZEN. I want my cheesecake to be soft and creamy, not hard. The Strawberry Mochi Ice Cream was good, but nothing mind-blowing. Service was friendly, yet we had to repeatedly ask for refills. We had just spent 2 hours in heavy armor beating each other with wooden swords so we were pretty parched.

The Walnut Miso was hot, creamy, and had walnut slivers layered throughout. Eiji offers mostly traditional rolls, but their Ceviche Roll (hamachi with homemade salsa) is non-traditional and tastes like a sushi taco!You pre-ordered dessert, so now things are going to the next level. The Strawberry Mochi has an actual strawberry inside it, wrapped in a layer of red bean paste and soft sticky rice cake. The Purple Sweet Potato Yokan features a subdued sweet purple yam cake topped with some rich vanilla ice cream on top.

During the next four half-hour appointments Tim massaged my arm, continued to do manual muscle tests to gauge progress, and taught me some exercises to prevent future injury. Pain dissipated and with Tim&#39;s recommended exercises, I&#39;m hoping to avoid dealing with this issue again. The only bad thing I have to say about Chiro is their billing department. After my second appointment, I met with their Patient Rights Advocate a.k.a. Bill Collector in disguise. He couldn&#39;t tell me how much I owed Chiro, but he insisted I put a payment down right there and then. When I asked him how much each appointment was going to cost me, he couldn&#39;t give me a straight answer, even though he had already spoken to my insurance company. I can understand that they might&#39;ve gotten duped in the past by patients who couldn&#39;t or didn&#39;t pay their bill, but that&#39;s no reason to treat everyone like a miscreant who is trying to nickel and dime you.In short, Tim was absolutely awesome, but their Patient Rights Advocate could stand to learn a thing or two about treating patients like people instead of thieves."

The Szechuan Dan Dan Noodles reminded me of an Italian spaghetti dish as it featured a heaping serving of spaghetti topped with ground meat. The noodles were thick and hearty, and once the spicy sauce sitting at the bottom of this dish was mixed in, the dish packed quite a punch. The Lanzhou Beef Ramen was good, but a bit too spicy for me. Featuring thin-cut slices of beef with noodles in a spicy-looking broth, I enjoyed a few bites before tears of joy and spiciness overwhelmed me.We also ordered some dim sum style dishes. The Green Onion and Beef Roll featured layers of dough, beef, and green onion, and was like a mixture between a fried and fresh roll. The Beef Pancakes were packed with beef and a ridiculous amount of broth: so much so that I got a fair amount on my shirt! The Leek Pancakes featured a soft dough shell, and were filled with tasty chives. While the noodle dishes were a bit spicy, these dim sum style items were not spicy at all.I was pleased with everything we ordered.

The meat sauce was flavorful, and the small chunks of boar meat sprinkled throughout made this dish a real winner.My sister got the gluten-free Penne Piccantine (Pomodoro sauce, chili peppers, garlic, fresh ricotta cheese and champignon mushroom). It wasn&#39;t a big mush of pasta like you normally get with gluten-free pasta, so if you hadn&#39;t told me it was gluten-free, I wouldn&#39;t have figured it out. The sauce in this dish was out of this world: thick, creamy, cheesy, with a little spicy kick. When my sister was done eating, I grabbed some bread and wiped every last drop of sauce off the plate! The restaurant boasts a great ambiance, and the staff is extremely personable and friendly. Aside from their gluten-free pasta, which is imported from Italy, all their pasta is homemade and it shows. I didn&#39;t get a chance to try any appetizers or desserts, but I&#39;ll definitely be coming back to Delizie. The place does Italian food true justice -- vera giustizia."

Like Chipotle, you&#39;ll enter and go through a station as you build your burrito, rice bowl, or salad. If you get a burrito -- or Burroti as they call it -- you&#39;ll get to watch them take a ball of dough and instantly turn it into a wrap with a magical, super-powered roti baking machine!I tried to go a bit healthier, so I went with Whole Wheat Roti and Brown Rice for my Burroti. I couldn&#39;t decide between Chicken or Paneer (Farmer&#39;s Cheese), so I asked for both and the server happily obliged. The Burroti was flavorful, and every bite that had some paneer in it was absolutely delightful. Flavor might&#39;ve not always been there, but with an extra side of Tikka Sauce at my side, that problem became no problem at all. The Burroti is a bit smaller than a Chipotle Burrito, but that isn&#39;t necessarily a bad thing.Tava is gluten-free friendly, but you won&#39;t be able to get their Burroti since they do not offer gluten-free wraps. I enjoyed my visit and will definitely visit Tava when I get a hankering for Indian Chipotle."

The cake was moist, flavorful, and the serving was absolutely massive. On the other hand, the Spicy Chewy Chocolate Cookie (gluten-free) tasted like it had almost no chocolate in it. My Peanut Butter Cookie (vegan) lacked a strong peanut flavor. The Strawberry Smoothie (strawberries, dates, vanilla, soymilk) was uninspiring at best.I would normally give a place like Plant Café two stars, but I applaud their effort to cater to people on restricted diets. At the end of the day, they didn&#39;t execute well on the majority of the items we sampled. Given we had some extraordinary vegan and gluten-free desserts at Zadin in the Mission earlier in the week, the bar might&#39;ve been too high from the get-go."

You order food at a register, then wait for your name to be called as the dishes come out from the kitchen, and you then go retrieve your food. If you order a few different items, you&#39;ll have everything only after a few trips to the serving area. My dining party ordered a bunch of items off the menu and we shared them family-style. I love bread so I wasn&#39;t surprised to find the big puffy thing -- Cholle Bhature -- was one of my favorite items. The fried bread by itself was awesome, but adding some spicy chickpeas upped the ante. I also enjoyed the Lamb Baida Roti, which is what I imagined an Indian quesadilla with lamb would taste like. I wasn&#39;t a fan of some other dishes we ordered. This was not because they were prepared poorly: our Indian dining partner assured me every dish met his expectations. I just personally wasn&#39;t a fan of the flavors and textures. The Dahi Pakori featured lentil dumplings that seemed a bit too dry, and the yogurt they were served in was a bit too tart for my tastes. I found a similar tartness in the yogurt-lathered Dahi Batata Puri.While every dish didn&#39;t appeal to my tastes, Vik&#39;s seems to be the place to go for Indian food in Berkeley. During my visit, I ran into two coworkers -- one dropping his daughter off at school and another driving down from Tahoe.

Our other dining partner enjoyed a bowl of Tiger Prawns with Garlic Noodles. The noodles -- tossed in soy garlic sauce, egg, butter -- were pleasantly dense and packed with flavor.For dessert, we ordered the Brownie with Mitchell&#39;s Coconut Ice Cream -- the gluten-free and regular version.

A member of our party had a gluten sensitivity so we went with gluten-free thin crusts for both our pies. The gluten-free crust was great: thin, moist, and didn&#39;t fall apart -- as most gluten-free products normally do. Blue Line Pizza had earned a solid 4 stars, but then we ordered the two dessert items they offer: Caramel Apple Breading Pudding and a Open-Faced Gelato Sandwich. Even though our server told us both were great, both were incredibly underwhelming and disappointing, especially compared to the pizza. The bread pudding was totally uniform; it was not crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, like I&#39;ve come to expect of good bread pudding. It was also too chewy and had an undesired rubbery texture to it. The Gelato Sandwich featured an uninspiring (perhaps even flat-out bland) cookie on a bed of mediocre ice cream. At least, microwave the cookie!I wish we could forget about dessert so I could give this place a higher rating because the pizza was really top notch. That said, I highly recommend Blue Line Pizza, but only if you skip over dessert."

You can go wrong at The Counter because with great power to build your own burger comes power to build a complete disaster. Keep it simple and don&#39;t add everything you like.

The yellow curry on top was quite a lot thicker than the more runny traditional Portuguese dish I&#39;m used to, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. The Watercress and Tender Pork Ribs Soup was packed with pieces of pork that infused the broth with flavor. The Steamed Pork Dumplings with Soup, with thin skin and filled with a rich broth, were better than most others I&#39;ve had.

I have no complaints about Ania and her work, but do think the office environment could improve on a few things that blemished an otherwise great experience. During my massage there was music playing from a therapeutic radio station on Sirius XM.

I&#39;ll admit I was a bit skeptical as I walked up to a truck to order sushi rolls, but after the first bite, my concerns were put to rest.  The Wheel of Fire (Spicy California Roll topped with tuna, jalapeño slices, chef&#39;s special sauce) was a good roll that provided a manageable spicy twist on the tried and true California Roll. But it was the Lobster Crunch (Lobster salad in a light wasabi dressing, cucumber, avocado in soy wrap) that made my mouth water for more. The lobster salad was spot on: hot, flavorful, with a spicy tease. The fried soy wrap gave the entire dish a crunchy texture, which complemented the gooey lobster salad.I was seriously considering getting back in line to order some more food after enjoying these two rolls, but opted to sample some of the other food trucks during our visit to Off the Grid. Next time We Sushi rolls into town, you can be sure I&#39;m going to sample their other offerings."

On the other hand, the Red Velvet was disappointingly dry. That said, for cupcakes coming out of a van, we were highly impressed with Kara&#39;s Cupcakes."

The Dungeness Crab Cake was very juicy and came with a good amount of lime and pepper relish. However, it turned out to be the weakest dish. The Seafood Caldo was a spicy tomato-cilantro broth featuring different soft pieces of fish that just melted in your mouth. The Burrata provided a great mixture of sweet (roasted heirloom tomatoes), savory (arugula) flavors, and soft (burrata), crunchy (toast) textures.Our entrées were top notch. My dining partner loved the Sea Scallops dish, featuring three huge, fresh, tender scallops, a tomato-truffle butter sauce, and a mound of delicious savory rice custard. Tasting all three in one bite was astounding. I ordered Spätzle, a hearty dish that came with small, thick flour-based noodles, delicious pieces of braised wagyu sugo, burnt chard, and aged asiago to give the entire dish a smooth, creamy texture. Again, delicious!Dessert topped off our amazing experience. My dining partner enjoyed a Straus Organic Mint and Espresso Mud Pie with Chocolate Sauce, featuring ice cream with pieces of espresso beans and a crunchy and chewy chocolate cookie base. Our waitress hyped up the Strawberry Peach Cobbler with Vanilla Ice Cream, so I ordered that. Even with the hype, the cobbler absolutely blew my mind! It was just a perfect blend of flavors and textures. The cobbler was warm, soft, chewy and moist. The ice cream was cool and flavorful. The peaches and strawberries were warm and sweet. In short, the dish was perfection."

Prepare to spend a couple of hours exploring every nook and cranny of this aquarium because it is totally worth it. The bay and ocean is home to some interesting forms of life that truly boggle the mind. The aquarium is wildly popular, and right in the tourist trap of Cannery Row, so expect the place to be packed with visitors. You&#39;ll have to wait a few minutes at each exhibit for a chance to look at the wildlife up close. Also, expect to pay an arm and a leg for parking. Not a huge deal, but prepare to endure a frustrated search.And now, time for an educational rant. For some mind-boggling reason, it seems visitors love watching the &#34;cute&#34; sea otters. I know the aquarium is supposed to be family friendly, but I wish there would was some education about the uglier side of otters. They are intelligent enough (like humans, monkeys, and dolphins) to get a twisted joy out of doing messed up stuff. Just between 2000 and 2002 there were fifteen documented cases of sadistic otters raping, and during the process killing, baby harbor seals right in the Monterey Bay!"

Each bite of this burger just melted in your mouth, with a little hint of garlic, and a wave of strong, creamy Gorgonzola Mayonnaise.The bowl of Signature Soup Cream of Garlic was great. It offered a thick texture with satisfying garlicky flavor that wasn&#39;t too overpowering. The Garlic Chicken and Eggplant Panini (grilled chicken, eggplant, tomatoes, garlic, smoked mozzarella, pesto spread) was also good.

To be honest, I haven&#39;t yet acquired a taste Asian-style desserts, but I actually really liked this item.

The bounty of sago pearls added to the mixture of textures in this dish.We also tried a Hot Dessert Sampler. This comes with some Sweet Peanut Dumpling (mochi with ground peanuts), Dun Dan (steamed egg custard), Dun Lai (steamed milk custard), and Sesame Paste.

Even though it&#39;s fried, the small tofu bites are so lightly fried, they almost seem baked. Fried goods are usually kept moist by covering them in a layer of breading.

She thought the meat seemed overcooked and was hard to chew, but I thought it was just right.Thai House has got everything else figured out, so it stands to benefit greatly from improvements to its food offerings."

Instead, I picked one size and they served me with a larger size. And these sizes are extremely awkward -- I ordered a Prince size and they gave me a Queen.

The place was bustling with a younger crowd playing games and checking out the cards for sale. Right next to the entrance is a calendar packed with events.The store owner, Ben, quickly introduced himself and asked what brought me in. When I told him I was more of a video gamer, he didn&#39;t shun me, but talked about how he was once a video game programmer. We had a pleasant chat about his past career and what card games were popular these days. He invited me to look around and holler at him with any questions. When someone wanted to buy a card I was surprised and happy to see that Ben looked up prices online (with the monitor facing both him and the customer) and gave them the average price he found online.More than just a store that sells cards, D20 Games seems like a great place for kids (and adults) to hang out and engage in some old-school face-to-face gaming. If that&#39;s your kind of thing, definitely check out D20."

During school, I had a love-hate relationship with the Phat Lady -- a cheese steak sandwich with mozzarella sticks and french fries. I loved how the layers of meat and fried goods blended in my mouth, but hated how it made my heart and arteries cry out in pain. That didn&#39;t stop me from eating this wonderful creation far more often than I should have.The bread -- vessel of goodness -- is a plain Italian white loaf. It&#39;s not bad, but I think there is some opportunity for improvement. I hope I can one day enjoy a Phat Lady on a loaf seasoned in garlic and covered in Asiago cheese.They also do build-to-order sandwiches. Once, I was craving hot dogs. When I walked into Hoagie Haven, I decided I didn&#39;t just want a plain old hotdog, but one with french fries, mozzarella sticks, and chicken nuggets. It was delicious!Since I graduated, it seems like they have done some culinary experiments and have discovered deep frying chunks of Mac n&#39; Cheese. During a recent visit, I tried the Mac Daddy - a Bacon Cheeseburger with deep fried Mac n&#39; Cheese wedges, french fries, and honey mustard. Let&#39;s just say the Phat Lady now has some serious competition for my favorite artery-clogging hoagie!My arteries don&#39;t miss you Hoagie Haven, but not a day (okay, maybe week) goes by that I don&#39;t think about biting into a delicious, greasy hoagie!"

Every ingredient played its part in making this dish great, especially the vinegar that gave every slurp and bite a tangy kick. My dining partners and I shared an order of Juicy Pork Steam Dumplings (xiao long bao). The skin of these dumplings was a little too thick, which overpowered the flavor of the pork inside.

Compared to the Butter Chicken, the Chicken Tikka Masala has larger chunks of chicken in a lighter masala sauce.While I&#39;m a big fan of their main chicken dishes, their vegetarian entrées shine as well. My favorite is the Navratan Korma, which features mixed vegetables and nuts cooked in a thick, creamy white sauce. The deep fried potato and cheese dumplings in tomato sauce -- the Malai Kofta -- is another great dish, although I wish each order contained more dumplings. The Kadhai Paneer -- which features cottage cheese, bell peppers, and onions cooked in a light tomato sauce -- is another personal favorite.The staff here is incredibly kind and helpful. I&#39;ve called in large orders for lunches at my company -- an hour before lunch.

I also really like the succulent Jamaican Jerked Chicken as well as the St. Louis-Cut Spare Ribs, which are drenched in a not-too-spicy hot sauce.That said, I&#39;m a not a huge fan of BBQ, but their sides are amazing; I wouldn&#39;t mind just eating from their sides menu for a meal. My favorite is the BBQ baked beans: ridiculously large beans from the Iacopi Farm in Half Moon Bay with chunks of brisket, simmered in a smoky sauce. The Pull-Apart Potato Rolls are also delicious, especially when dunked in the butter sauce that comes with the Grilled Asparagus. The Cheezy Grits are great and the Potlikker Collard Greens once again proves that bacon can make anything delicious.Like other SF restaurants that deliver, they use bike couriers, but they pack their items in sturdy plastic containers. This keeps your food safe as it tumbles around in the courier&#39;s backpack."

Every flavor was rich and true to its name. Of these three, I enjoyed Strawberry and Banana the most. My sister got a sugar cone with Toasted Almond and Claire&#39;s Pie (coffee ice cream with fudge, almonds, chocolate chips, and graham crunch pieces) and thoroughly enjoyed it. My cousin got a waffle cone with White Pistachio and Toasted Almond. A fan of pistachios, she felt the ice cream did pistachios justice!We heard a lot of good things about the Ube (purple yam) flavor so we got a single scoop. The taste of their Ube is subtle and can be overpowered by stronger flavors, so cleanse your palate before diving into this unique flavor. They use a deli-style waiting system: you grab a numbered ticket when you come in and are served when your number is called. Even if you come in close to closing time, as long as you grab a ticket, you will be served -- so don&#39;t fret!My first taste of Mitchell&#39;s was very enjoyable, and I&#39;m looking forward to returning to explore more of the 40+ flavors they offer."

My favorite appetizer is the Goofy Fries: soft garlic fries covered in melted cheddar and chunks of pastrami. The Gratineed Macaroni &amp; Cheese is good, but I&#39;ve had better at other places. If you want to explore the hidden side of The Refuge, order the PASTRAMI STEAK from the SECRET MENU! Instead of getting your delicious pastrami chopped up in a sandwich, you&#39;ll enjoy a ridiculously large slab of pastrami so tender you can cut it with your fork. I always go with the Swiss &amp; Mustard, which features huge chunks of pastrami, swiss, and mustard on toasted rye. If you like all that AND like sauerkraut, go with the popular Reuben. They also have ribeye cheesesteaks and burgers, supposedly... But I can&#39;t stop eating the pastrami, so I can&#39;t honestly say!The climax of your meal approaches: dessert. Order the Superlative Bread Pudding. It&#39;s so hard to put into words how delicious it is. The outside is perfectly crispy and the inside so sweet and soft, resulting in a gastronomic nirvana! The serving is large and you&#39;ll likely be stuffed by this point. So remember, boys and girls, this gift from the Gods should be shared with friends."

Aside from all the meat and vegetables you get to throw into your hot pot, I love the Mongolian beef pie. A pancake filled with ground beef pan-fried to absolute perfection, I might blasphemously believe this is the best thing on their entire menu. These also keep really well in the fridge and can be reheated in a toaster oven to near out-of-the-kitchen freshness.If you somehow have room in your stomach for dessert, their dessert items are pretty good! My favorite is the Phoenix Egg Yolk Bun (Lai Wong Bao): a egg yolk wrapped in a soft steamed bun.The staff is super friendly and down to earth. One time, my friend got pretty drunk, began claiming he was the most sober member of our group, and started walking around the restaurant looking for the restroom and eventually stumbled into the kitchen. The people in the back and the waiters laughed it off and sent him back to us. A few weeks later, I came in and our waiter from that night asked if my &#34;super sober friend&#34; was coming!"

While their traditional rolls are great, I&#39;m a sucker for their more unique rolls. The Volcano Roll is a spicy tuna roll covered with salmon and spicy mayo, baked to perfection. The Sharks Roll is a spicy deep-fried roll that reminds me of my favorite comfort sushi restaurant: Cha Cha Sushi in San Jose. The Imperial Roll is a tangy fried roll with a bread crumb nori wrap. The Stanford Roll (you might&#39;ve heard of this university) is an eel/avocado roll covered with spicy tuna. There is never much room left after I go through all of my favorite rolls, but coworkers who order entrées -- like the black cod -- always sing its high praises. My friend who is a lot better than me at discerning freshness always looks forward to their uni and sashimi.The chefs and staff are both extremely friendly. I got to know them well since I came in often to grab Smule&#39;s large dinner orders. At some point, I crossed &#34;that threshold&#34; and the chefs began offering me these unique, off-the-menu, complimentary hand rolls whenever I rolled in. When word of these legendary hand rolls spread, I got a lot more offers to help pick up the sushi!"

As she takes your order, she&#39;ll yell out the items in Chinese to the chef. This was a bit disconcerting at first because I thought she was yelling at me for ordering something wrong, but I quickly got used to the ad-hoc three-person conversation. Whenever I finished ordering, she always kindly recommended (pushed) another item or two to make sure I had the Chinese take-out food groups -- meat, fish, rice, and veggies -- covered.The menu is huge. While I try to avoid ordering like an American at Chinese restaurants, I can&#39;t help myself at Da Sichuan because the &#34;American Chinese&#34; dishes are so good. I also might not be able handle their more authentic dishes because they are so mind numbingly spicy. The General&#39;s Chicken is covered in chilis and a reddish-brown sauce, which pack a small kick. The Walnut Prawns are fantastically fried and covered in an addictive, sweet mayonnaise. The potstickers are great: thick-skinned and bursting with tasty broth. So be careful not to burn yourself when eating them! My one complaint: the Mongolian Beef dish should be called Mongolian Onions since you get so many onions and so little beef. I&#39;ve ordered this a few times and gotten the same beef-to-onion ratio so I&#39;m suspecting the beef is there to merely season the onions! Smule&#39;s co-founder, Ge Wang, is a huge fan of this place. When he calls Da Sichuan, instead of saying hello, all he says is, &#34;It&#39;s me,&#34; and they know exactly who it is. Also, Ge told me the name of the chef translated to English is Jackie Chan. I&#39;m still not quite sure if he&#39;s trolling me..."

Yep - we ate from this fine place about once a week and no one ever complained!Their menu features so many great dishes that you&#39;ll have to visit several times before you even cover my favorites. Iskender&#39;s Favorite is a delicious entree consisting of lamb and beef in a buttery tomato sauce blend and a side of thick, creamy yogurt. This entree is very heavy, so you might want to share it with a dining partner! Going a bit lighter, the Moussaka Plate is a perfect confection of eggplant, lamb, beef, potato, and veggies covered in a delicious homemade tomato sauce. If you want to sample all the meats this place offers, check out the Combo Grill Plate; or if you&#39;re in the mood for fish, the perfectly tender salmon in the Grilled Salmon plate never disappoints.The meals always arrived in a very reasonable amount of time, and Don, their delivery guy, is really nice and funny. The Smule team now works out of a San Francisco office. When dinnertime rolls around I know there are many Smuleans wishing Anatolian Kitchen would deliver to our SF office!"

My dining partner and I shared an Assiette Chasseur plate which came with a large slab of pâté, mustard, and pieces of baguette. The pâté was great although more bread would&#39;ve been nice, since we weren&#39;t even halfway through the pâté when it ran out. Afterwards, I had the delicious Quiche Lorraine (bacon, onions, Gruyère) which had a crisp, yet soft crust.  My dining partner got the daily special: the French burger with brie, which came with three large, gooey slices of brie. Sometimes burgers taste like an incongruous mixture of the drier and wetter ingredients, but every piece of this burger from bread to patty came together to create a perfectly juicy confection.The desserts were good, but didn&#39;t blow us away. The molten chocolate cake was a chocolate cake with melted chocolate on top. It did come with a homemade whipped cream made with nutmeg, which was actually quite refreshing. But the cake was nothing special. I had the crème brulée, which was passable.We had a great time and I&#39;m looking forward to trying the spicy lamb sausage sandwich on our next visit!"

There are plenty of complimentary classes, but I&#39;ve only done the Vinyasa Yoga, which I enjoyed. There is also a pool on the roof that I&#39;ve used a few times before accepting the fact that I&#39;m a terribly inefficient swimmer. I could pay a trainer a lot of money to make me more efficient, but... it&#39;s a lot of money.It&#39;s the little things that really make Equinox worth it for me. The chilled Eucalyptus towels sound absolutely unnecessary but are incredibly refreshing if you&#39;re working hard. The endless supply of Kheil&#39;s shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and body lotion leave me feeling SO SMOOTH after a workout. The complementary razors in the shower room have helped me keep my abnormally large head bald and shiny for months.All staff members, from the greeter at the front desk to the staff who keep the place spotless, are extremely friendly and personable.

My college friends always looked forward to visits from my family because that meant delicious custard cups were also coming. When my roommate TJ heard they were coming &#34;Oh god...&#34; was all he could mutter. When my parents moved out of Newark, they even got our American neighbors hooked on custard cups; our neighbors&#39; toddlers also look forward to my visits because there are guaranteed custard cup deliveries!I love bread, but Portuguese rolls are one-of-a-kind. I grew up on sloppy joes prepared on Portuguese rolls; they were the backbone of my lunch through most of elementary school! A toasted, buttered Portuguese roll with a glass of soymilk is my go-to breakfast when I visit home. Really, anything on a Portuguese roll transforms into something infinitely better. Growing up, whatever we had for dinner would quickly be put into a Portuguese roll and it always resulted in a delicious sandwich!My parents don&#39;t live in Newark anymore, but fortunately both of these Portuguese staples can be stored for up to a week. Throw the custard cups in the fridge and freeze and the bread, and you&#39;ll never be without these gifts from the culinary gods."

That said, growing up in a Portuguese family, I went through boxes and boxes of delicious pastéis de nata (Portuguese custard cups) so I&#39;m partial to that style, and am actually not a huge fan of Chinese style egg tarts. My favorite item from my first trip here was the beef curry pie - a savory empanada filled with a spicy beef curry. Their cream bread disappointed me a bit, but that may be because I have recently enjoyed awesome cream bread at bakeries in Seoul. The bread&#39;s outer shell was a bit too rubbery in texture and the cream inside was not anything special.The lines get long here, but the workers are not only efficient at fulfilling orders, but also really friendly. This place is also cash-only so don&#39;t waste your time standing in line if you don&#39;t have cash!I love steamed pork buns and was looking forward to giving theirs a try.

Every bite is an excellent mix of cheesy goodness, perfectly crispy bacon, and a little kick from the jalapeños. I usually get this as part of the The Red, White and Blue Plate Special which gives you a slightly smaller sandwich with a soup or salad. Their smoky tomato soup has been a hit-or-miss for me as sometimes it just seems too watered down. They also serve breakfast sandwiches until 11 AM on weekdays. The Smule team absolutely loves them. My favorite is the Breakfast Piglet which features sharp cheddar, ham, apple mustard, and rosemary butter on delicious levain bread. And just when you thought these guys were a one-trick-grilled-cheese-sandwich pony, you realize they also do baked goods amazingly well. Their muffins, especially the berry-infused ones, are great. My favorite is the blueberry and raspberry muffin, which is filled with whole berries. They bake them in the morning, but sometimes they have some left over that you can grab at lunchtime.During lunch, the line extends out the door so avoid coming at exactly noon if you are in a rush. They have seating inside and outside. Although all the seating might be taken as you arrive, something usually frees up while you are waiting for your food to come out."

But if you want a unique melt-in-your-mouth experience, Cha Cha is the place for you!Their special rolls prove that you can&#39;t go wrong if you go big with your rolls and add in some frying and baking. Take my personal favorite, the Alaskan Crispy, a deep fried salmon and cream cheese roll topped with wasabi mayo, unagi sauce and tobiko. As a piece melts in my mouth, my arteries cry out in pain as they are slowly clogged with a rich mixture of cream cheese and salmon. Worth it! I really enjoy their baked rolls which both start out life as a simple California Roll: the Lion King adds tender baked salmon, and the Ocean Side adds succulent baked scallops. Even rolls that I did not particularly fall in love with, like the spicy tuna-based Sparky, are delicious. The Sparky actually ranked very highly with my dining partners and I totally did not regret having three pieces of it! On my most recent visit, we gave the dessert menu a try and just when I was convinced Cha Cha could only provide an amazing experience via their sushi rolls, I was proven wrong. The vanilla tempura ice cream, covered in a thick pie-like crust with a dollop of whipped cream was absolutely delicious. The tempura ice cream can also comfortably feed four as it is a nicely sized breaded ball cut into four pieces. The menu should aptly rename the green tea ice cream to Goblet of Green Tea Ice Cream as it was served in a giant goblet and fed four of us with some left to spare. The mochi ice cream (one order cut into four pieces) is also above average. Do note that they drizzle chocolate sauce on all their dessert items. We have had some waiters ask and some not, but if you&#39;re not a fan of chocolate like me or don&#39;t want chocolate distracting your taste buds, just ask for them to not put chocolate on your dessert items!They are wildly popular and busy, and they don&#39;t take reservations -- so expect a bit of a wait even if you come on a weekday. Two people can usually get seated within 15 minutes, especially if you don&#39;t mind sitting at the sushi bar. I have found coming with four people is the way to go for maximizing the amount of rolls you get to try as most rolls come cut into eight pieces. Expect a slightly longer wait if your party is larger, especially if you want a table. That said, whether we have had to wait 30 minutes or an hour, once we&#39;re seated and eating no one seems to mention the wait ever again!The restaurant is clean, well-maintained and the service is great. The rolls come out ridiculously fast even when the place is packed -- so if you had to wait a while to be seated, do not fret as your wait will be quickly rewarded. The complimentary spicy mussels and green tea add a nice touch to an already amazing and ridiculously economical experience. Rolls range in price but average around $10 per roll. If you love your friends and family, bring them here. You owe it to them. And for being such a good person, you will be rewarded as well!"

I stopped by for lunch with some friends and we fell in love during our first visit and try to stop by here at least once a month to get some tasty dumplings and dim sum.If you&#39;re getting dumplings, go with the freshly handmade crab/pork soup dumplings (xiaolongbao) and skip over their other dumplings that are frozen. The soup dumplings are absolutely delicious. They come out piping hot, so give it a minute, then get the dumpling in your mouth, close your eyes, and prepare to bite down and release an amazing mixture of broth, pork, and crab! Yum!Some of my other favorite items on the menu include their tasty chive pancakes which are empanada-like in structure. Lightly fried to perfection, they&#39;re filled with scrambled egg, chives, and rice noodle. You basically get two &#34;empanadas&#34; cut in half so this can comfortably feed four. Their pork buns are savory and are not filled with the traditional sweet pork you normally get in steamed buns, but they are great nonetheless. Their spicy wontons are also great - actually pretty spicy and drenched in a thick peanut sauce.They also do entree dishes, but we haven&#39;t explored that side of the menu very thoroughly though we did get an eggplant entree once which we both enjoyed!The decor isn&#39;t anything to brag about but the restaurant is clean and the staff has always been friendly and attentive during our many visits.The absolute worst part about eating here is we have both honed in on our absolutely favorite items leaving very little room to experiment. Fortunately, we&#39;ve realized that bringing along family and friends gives us more mouths to feed and more opportunity to explore their menu!"
